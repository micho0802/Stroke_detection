At the time, it devastated my life. Via heart arrhythmia, I took a blood clot to the right side of the brain.  I lost about 40-50% of control/motor ability on the entire left side of my body. I lost my ability to play guitar, sing, play sports, run, etc. It put me in debt, destroyed my dating life, and impacted my mental health to the point that I was suicidal. I lived alone, and would have nightmares that I would pass away in my house and nobody would find me for an extended period of time. 

(ok, sad part is over)

If you're struggling, there is light on the other side of this journey. Once I accepted my life would never be the same, I started viewing the abilities I was slowly regaining as small victories and it flipped the narrative completely. I became more in tune with my mental health, I started taking care of my body, and progress started to show.

Recovery is easier said than done, and I do have my bad days (and that's ok). 

My speech and motor abilities have come a long way. My foot drop is really manageable. I've driven across the United States. I've met an amazing woman. I've seen Prague, Amsterdam, Brussels, and Munich. I've tried dancing ( with not much success). I've improved my relationship with family members, etc. I assure you, I wouldn't have accomplished any of this if I wouldn't have gained the perspective that my stroke gifted me. I'm still human and I still take things for granted - but far less often. 

If you're going through it now, I'm sorry. You have a lot of work ahead of you, but don't let the dark drown out all your light. The hard part was surviving, now go kick some ass.

1d5pj14,stroke,1717255770.0,"I cannot even remember how many posts I have uploaded in this community with my concerns, questions, and hope.

November of 2023, my 67 yo dad had a major hemorrhagic stroke on his left brain, leaving him paralyzed, unable to speak, unable to eat and stage 4 pressure ulcers. He had been fighting the whole time. I tried my absolute best as his main point of contact and coordinator, and caregiver, to bring my father back with rehab. I realized that a lot of the things are out of my control and that US health care system is broken.

My dad had his initial surgical clipping surgery, then 2x surgeries for VP shunt because first one failed. 3 hospitalizations from sepsis and high grade fever.

Recently he had another septic shock and second stroke in the occipital lobe, and even one of the well known and established hospital in the country still cannot figure out the origin of infection, where it is coming from.
His stage 4 pressure ulcers shows no significant signs of improvement due to broken health care system at the SNF and some of the neglecting nurses at the hospital, too lazy to turn him every 2 hours.

After speaking with many different doctors, they believe that continuing full care for father is pointless, as their expectations of his physical recovery is low. Knowing what father would want if he was able to speak for himself, everything that he has gone through since November, probability of his future recovery, constant infection, poor health care system, and father's quality of life in the future,
we decided on hospice care so he can rest peacefully from this harsh and cruel world.

We are expecting him home today or tomorrow. I've been sleeping at the hospital next to him for the past one week, eating at the hospital for one week, I don't think I will ever be ready to let him go. Seeing his big smile when I walk in, makes me weak and second question my decision. It feels like my life is shattered and my heart tearing apart into million pieces. I love you so much dad.

I don't know why I'm even writing this nor the point of this post, I just had to let this out somewhere.

For the last couple of years I have felt off, sort of... well, more stupid - like my intelligence was declining as well as my memory. (Now I know that this was likely due to the cavernoma on my brain stem.) Then I had the stroke last month and it made everything much worse.

I used to be quite smart. I'm a nurse (LPN) - although currently on short term disability - and took a lot of pride in my job. I desperately want to return back to work but I'm terrified that I don't have the brain capacity. I used to read a lot, watched documentaries, did research, took charge of projects, and did well with generally everything I put effort into.

Now, I feel that I will not be a good nurse because truthfully I don't remember much of anything I've been taught - and I'm afraid I will miss something significant and endanger a patient. I'm also just missing my intelligence. I don't mean to sound like I was smarter than the average person, I just don't even feel average anymore. I don't know how to put it into words, and I don't know what to do about it.

She survived with almost no use of her entire left side... she had a tracheostomy and I kept telling her she was going to be okay, and that she was going to make it.

Fast forward to September and she got out of the hospital and into a rehabilitation center to work on her left side. She kept getting pneumonia and had a habit of taking her traech out. Both nurses and I told her she needs to stop before she caused some real damage

Last Sunday, she and I were having a text conversation about us seeing each other, as she had an appointment the next day, and I usually went with her so I can speak for her, when she went silent

It turns out she had pulled out her traech in entirety and started to suffocate, and the nurses found her 10-20 minutes later, blue and unresponsive.

They revived her and sent her to the ER, where they did more scans on her brain, and found severe hypoxic damage to all parts of her brain and she's basically in a coma with little to no hope of recovery... and I'm in shambles.

ycs946,stroke,1666660956.0,"4 years ago today I was working from home as I had my furnace guy in doing the annual inspection.  I remember that he was inspecting the gas fireplace and had the glass panel on the floor.  I remember stepping over the glass to go to the basement to look at the furnace‚Ä¶ then I remember waking up in the hospital over a week later.  

I vaguely recall ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù and seeing my mother and her telling me is was in the hospital and that I had a brain hemorrhage.  I can still see the look on my wife‚Äôs face as I struggled to comprehend where I was or what was the date.  I didn‚Äôt have the wherewithal to tell the Doctors that I had no idea where I was because I never went there.  I had no recollection of arriving, walking through the lobby.  I couldn‚Äôt understand dates cause time had no meaning.  There were no windows in the icu, and the lighting was always the same.

I was confused.  I wasn‚Äôt angry, that would come later.  I wasn‚Äôt sad, that would come after anger.  I was stuck in a moment where changes occurred and my brain would not or could not comprehend what had happened.  I struggled through the daily barrage of questions I could not answer.  I tried to put up a strong front for my family, but was happier when they went home each night and I could stop trying to be strong for them.  

I was in a bad place, both mentally and physically.  But one day, they got my to stand on my own, and I walked a few feet into my wife‚Äôs arms.  I can still see the tears in both her and my moms eyes (tears may have been caused by weeks of sub par sponge baths).  Those first few steps were the start of the journey back to myself.  Once I was able to walk the hallways, I was able to better understand where I was; though I never got the date right.

I completed Rehab, went home then completed the outpatient program.  I got my license back.  I just completed a second rehab program focusing on activity levels to increase cardio ability and decrease blood pressure.  I also crushed a second surgery cause sometimes coils can be assholes.

I also got help with depression.  Have gotten lost getting home from the store.  I have forgotten way to many things.  My attention span is horrible.  I am no longer able to work and thus have lost the job that I loved.  

But I learned (and am still learning) to adapt.  Lists are my friend.  Waze always gets me home.  I am way more active and am losing weight.  I am cooking incredible meals for my wife (when I can focus on the recipe properly) and I realized that I worked too much.

4 years ago today my life changed.  The lives of my loved ones were altered.  The path that I thought my life was to take was derailed.  But at some point, when my subconscious was ready, I started to take small parts of myself back from the stroke.  I am different than what I was, but I cannot say I am a worse version of me.  The parts that I lost have been replaced with empathy, perseverance and hope.

I hope this brings small comfort to everyone who has made it through this overly long diatribe.  The road to recovery is long,  but I think it is a journey worth the effort.  We all experience stroke differently, and my story will not be yours, but it is one story of too many, and I hope offers a bit of hope.

Lastly, caregivers are awesome.  In some respects it is harder on you than us.  Please know that you are loved.  Please remember to take care of yourselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/ycs946/4_years_ago/,4 years ago,,75,26,0.99

1ec28dw,stroke,1721932316.0,"I had a stroke back on December 27th, 2023.. it affected the right side of my body, and it took away my ability to walk, my ability to drive, my ability to go to work, and also took a good chunk of my sanity...

Today, July 25th, 2024, I can walk, I can use my right hand, and now, I have the dexterity and fortitude on my right side to drive again. I've been exercising and practicing for today, because today I was able to find out how fast my response time would be switching my foot from the gas pedal to the brake pedal.. normally it has to be below .5 of a second, and I was able to get to .42 of a second. They also have something called Dyna vision, it's a large wall with buttons on it that light up colors, and you hit the button in order to turn the light off.. the standard is to hit 50 of these buttons within a 60 second time limit, I am now hitting with both hands, 73 within the 60 second time limit.

Everyday that I continue to practice, continue to exercise, continue to practice dexterity, movement on my right hand and right foot, is a day closer that I get to getting my life back... I also am starting to feel small things in my hand, not the texture yet, but the shape of the object, or the fact that I can just barely feel that something is actually in my hand.. this is a big step from where it used to be, because when this first happened I had no feeling in my hand whatsoever, I couldn't move my fingers, I couldn't hold anything in my hand. 

I'm sharing this good news with all of you because I know there are those here who have suffered a stroke and face depression, defeatism, anger, grief, believe me I know this, I have gone through all of this and more.. even got very scary for me on one day, the police had to be called to do a welfare check on me.. that's how bad it got, so I know what you're going through 

I'm writing to you to tell you to don't give up on yourself, don't stop your therapy, don't quit, keep doing it, keep pushing yourself, keep exercising, no matter what it may be, you can do this, I had once thought I would never reach this level again, but here I am, with the ability to drive again.. if I can do this, you can too. 

I know you can do this. I know you can. The worst thing you can do is let your depression and grief about what happened overwhelm you and enslave you.. don't let that happen to you. Surround yourself with people who love you, who want to help you, and will encourage you. If you're a man of faith, dive into your faith and don't blame your God for the problem, because pointing the blame is not going to help.. 

the best thing you can do is the physical therapy and occupational therapy that will help you gain back what you've lost. I speak at all of this from experience, because everything I mentioned above, I did do... I learned the hard way, and I don't want you to go through that. I'd rather see you do better than me, I'd rather see you recover quicker than me 

And again, if I can do this, even the midst of what I have done to myself, either blaming myself or blaming my God, I still was able to get my head out of the mental fog that I was in, put my feet to the floor, or my hand to the grinder, and plowed through...

If I did all this, and now have the ability to drive, to go back to work, to regain my use of my right hand, then I know beyond a shot of a doubt that you can too.

11h4pma,stroke,1677860311.0,"It's been 5 months since my wife (F54) suffered a major stroke and it obviously flipped our world upside down. Paralysed down her left side, left arm spasticity, and total loss of independence, I felt totally helpless.

We were not at all prepared for what ensued, after all, how can you be? I was, and still am, incredibly focused on her care and helping her heal as best she can to whatever version of herself we can recover.

However, I wanted to share our top twenty list of purchases that I made with anyone that might find these useful. I couldn't find a list of what to buy no matter how hard I tried, but hopefully this list will help someone, or make you think about something previously you had not.

Obviously, your situation may be, and probably will be, entirely different, but for what it's worth, here's my top twenty purchases that made her life a little easier, introduced a little more independence, and started to give her back some semblance of control of her life.

&#x200B;

1. **Bathroom > Wet Room conversion.**  
This is not cheap - at least not where I live anyway. Converting the bathroom, removing the bath, and replacing it with a walk in shower with seat and rails fundamentally changed her expectation of self care. Honestly cannot put a value on this. Whether she is sitting in the chair just staying under a hot stream of water for relaxation, or whether I am standing behind her washing her hair - it's a life changer.
2. **Stair Lift.**  
My God this was expensive but a complete and utter life-changer for her. Walking with a cane now, she would have been cut off from the rest of the house had it not been for this stair lift. We have a very narrow staircase, but there is a UK company that makes stair lifts specifically for narrow stairs.
3. **Blood Pressure Monitor.**  
Not only piece of mind, but necessary to monitor the effect of the various tablets she is taking. We don't use it as often now, as ironically, taking her BP gives her anxiety and raises her BP more.
4. **Bathroom Grab Rails.**  
Safety first right? Combined with any changes you make to your bathroom environment, these provide a safe, secure, and empowering way your best bud can move around the room as much as they can without assistance.
5. **Shower Chair.**  
Even if you don't go the route we did of a total bathroom conversion, you can get a chair that fits in the bath with arm rests that will provide stability and security for your best bud while they just enjoy alone time.
6. **Lightweight Wheelchair.**  
The wheelchair provided by the NHS (UK health service) was heavy, bulky, didn't fold. If you need a wheelchair, get a lightweight one so that all members of your support group can lift it in and out of their car/steps easily. And I strongly recommend getting a wheelchair gel seat - nice on the buns and warmer.
7. **Lightweight, Single-Handed Adjustable Shower Head.**  
This was actually purchased after several glasses of wine and I thought, 'Well that could be ace if it works!'. It's a very light, one-handed shower head attachment that the various modes can be operated simply by one-handed clicks of a button on the attachment, bearing in mind she can only use one hand. Full stream to rainforest style - she loves it.
8. **Vacuum Suction Shower Head Holders.**  
The shower head that I bought in no. 7 above does create a slight issue in that the shower hose then drapes across her body - this fixes that. Small, vacuum suction hooks around the shower cubicle means that she can put the hose over those and drape the hose around the shower cubicle any way she wants. We have four in place for a variety of positions and obviously, they can be moved to anywhere because they are suction based.
9. **Vacuum Suction Shower Caddies.**  
Same as above, giving her direct access to her range of haircare, shower gels, and weird girl stuff at various heights has given her more alone time that is safe and prevents over balancing. 
10. **Swivel Car Chair Seat.**  
This ace little device is basically two round pieces of material that pivot really well. It's great for helping with car transfers where she can sit in, rotate in place, and feel comfortable.
11. **The 'Knork'.**  
You've heard of the Spork right? The combination of a spook and fork? Well this is the fork with sharpened outer edges version - the Knork! It means that she can cut her own food as well as feed herself. More freedom. It's a win.
12. **Electric Heated Shoulder Wrap.**  
This really should be number 3 if I'm honest! It's like a shawl with a fastening button that she can put over her shoulders when her spasticity became painful and travelled into her neck. It's got a timer, a heat range, and is good for soothing as well as general warmth. The button doesn't have to be fastened, so it's also ideal to just wrap around her feet when she's feeling a little chilly or wants some heat on her affected foot.
13. **Easy-To-Put-On Trainers/Sneakers.**  
As time progressed, my wife was able to balance just right to reach her feet when seated but laces or even slip-ons didn't work for her. Laces are a no go with just one hand and slip-ons didn't provide the support required for her to walk properly even with a stick. Enter the 'NIKE Womens Air Zoom Pegasus Flyease' trainers/sneakers. They are slip-ons, but with zip and velcro fastening, so she can put them on herself (with a little assistance sometimes).
14. **Drink Bottle (Small) with Strap.**  
Being a British lady, my wife loves her tea. How can she carry hot (and cold) drinks around with one hand whilst that hand is focused on holding her walking cane? So simple - a small gym-style drink bottle with a strap on top! Hooked around one finger, she can carry it to the sink, fill the bottle with water, empty it into the kettle, boil it, make her tea, secure the lid, hang it on one finger (the cane holding hand), and get back to her comfy chair safely. She even leaves her tea cup next to her chair, and just refills the tea cup from the gym bottle. It has to be small by the way, otherwise the weight of the bottle and the liquid is too much for one finger!
15. **Lanyard Finger Straps.**  
These are tiny looped finger straps, the kind you'd put on a pen-knife. Using hanging, super glue, or just wrapping around items, my wife can carry anything light enough (including her phone) one little finger that also supports her walking cane.
16. **Neck/Waist Bag.**  
Remember bum bags? Fanny packs? Apparently they are back and in fashion for stroke sufferers! All joking aside, a bag with a strap that can go around my wife's neck is great for her carrying anything from fruit, lunch, drinks, and magazines from point A to point B while freeing up her good arm for the cane supported walking.
17. **Vacuum Suction Bath Hooks.**  
See no. 8 and 9 above.  Hooks, not grips. Great for hanging squeegees, cleaning items and even a safety razor for shaving those lovely legs!
18. **Heavy Duty Adhesive Hooks.**  
These are strategically placed around the house to be 'storage points' for hanging items. Two examples: we have one underneath the kitchen cabinet where she hangs her 'gripper' (those things that you squeeze and can pick things up off the floor) - she can feed the dog with that one, and we have one at the top, and the bottom of the stairs so that she doesn't have to take her walking stick with her - she just hooks one at the bottom, takes the stair lift, and takes the upstairs stick off it's own hook - this way the downstairs walking stick and all the germs on it from outside never makes it way to the bedroom.
19. **Car Dashboard Sticky Pads.**  
You can buy these sticky pads that go on the car dashboard, originally designed to stop your stuff from slipping off the dashboard when driving. Thing is, it turns out they are ideal to hold anything steady from plates while buttering some toast, gripping jars that can be undone with one hand, and generally giving steadiness to items in the kitchen that we take for granted if stuck onto the kitchen worktop. Top tip - cover them with cling film or plastic when not in use so they don't get dusty!
20. **Velcro Strap(s).**  
One of the most difficult things we had to 'fix' is keeping her foot in the safest place in many situations. In her wheelchair, her spasticity in her leg would cause her 'naughty' foot to slip off the footrest for example. You can buy a length of Velcro straps that can be cut to length that allowed us to effectively strap her foot in place to the footrest, preventing movement and injury.

I was going to include links to the products that I specifically bought, but I didn't want to fall foul of either advertising or showing something that isn't available in your country. Hopefully, you can find what works for you wherever you are.

I do hope that some of this has been useful and perhaps has given you some ideas to resolve some of the challenges that both you and your best bud are facing. It's not the end, it's a new start.

c1727a,stroke,1560666820.0,"Some background info:

We are both 28 and healthy. Biking, outdoors, and our two pups are the center of our life. She works in education and I work in healthcare. We just got engaged a short bit ago after living together for over a year. I just got a new job that more than doubled my income and lessened my time at work, and she just got onto summer break from teaching. We were planning a wedding, saving up for a house, and spending time soaking in Alaskan summer together. Things were absolutely perfect. However, Tuesday night our life would change for forever...

&#x200B;

I was at work and it was turning into a very busy shift. She texted once in a while and I would get back to her when I had a few minutes here and there. At about 7:30PM she started sending a few text messages that were confusing, but they weren't alarming. I saw them come in on my watch, but decided to not really deal with any of them. I had a short break and decided to grab dinner and respond to her texts. Maybe give her a call to say hi. It was nearly 10PM at this time. It had been 3 hours and 30 minutes since the stroke had occurred.

&#x200B;

I was walking around trying to size up the scene of all the yummy foods I had available to me and grabbed my phone out of my pocket. She had texted me a few times while I was getting ready to take a break. I read her texts and nothing she said made sense. She has the dogs with her. She is doing stuff. Maybe she just fat fingered her texts and sent them in haste? I didn't really know. She would later explain she was afraid to say anything about her not feeling right because she didn't want to bother anyone. Our puppy cam somehow recorded the whole timeframe in which she would first start showing symptoms. She simply laid on the floor and then got up and watched TV trying to see if the symptoms would go away. After texting to ask her if she could talk she simply said, ""only text,"" ""i can't talk."" I promptly ignored that as I felt it was a little too weird and called her. She answered the phone with panic in her voice. I couldn't understand anything she was saying, but I've seen aphasia in my own patients. My lizard brain immediately kicked in as I ran down some different diagnoses. Stroke... STROKE... IT'S A DAMN STROKE. No. Nope. Couldn't be. She's 28 and healthy! No way. Shut up. I asked her, ""Have you been drinking? Are you hurt?"" She struggled, but said ""no."" I told her to hang on and I would call her right back. I called my cousin to come by and check on her. I called her back and started asking her questions, ""What's wrong... Like what else is wrong with you. What's not normal."" She said, ""My face is numb..."" Panic ensued. I told her to hang up with me and call 911 immediately. She panicked. We both were panicking. I've seen this in real life so many times in other people, but -nothing- prepares you for this. I called my mom. I didn't know what else to do.

&#x200B;

Ambulances arrived at our home and my fianc√© was at the front door waiting for them. They initially were confused, but I am incredibly thankful they quickly caught onto the fact that this wasn't her being drunk or on drugs. They had somehow figured out what was going on. They took her to the hospital where she was in the ED and got a CT almost immediately. I work about 45 minutes away from this hospital, but made it there in 30 minutes. (Thankful there was a lack of cops on my route.) I arrived in the ED and my mom had called one of her good friends to be there with her since my mom lives in a different town. Her family lives across the country. She was so scared. She is so strong and such a stubborn woman. When I saw how scared she was it took almost everything I had to not break down right there. She later on would tell me that she was worried I was going to leave her after seeing her like that. She said I was silent and stoic. In fact I was in pure panic. I just didn't know what to do or say. Shortly after I got there they decided that this wasn't from a bleed, and that they were -barely- inside the window to give TPA. So they did. At almost exactly 4 hours after the stroke occurred.

&#x200B;

After being in the ER for what felt like 15 minutes, but was closer to 2 hours they admitted her to the ICU to be watched because of her having been administered TPA. Life after this gets suuuuper blurry. She slept. A lot. Her speech was still really hard to understand. It had been determined that she had right sided deficits with right arm weakness, right facial droop, and aphasia. I was still praying to whatever power existed in the universe that this wasn't a stroke, but it was. What comes next? Will we still be able to get married? Will she need to live in a nursing home? Will things EVER be normal again? No one could answer any of this. She would routinely wake up, look at me, and just cry. I wanted to cry, but I wanted to be her stability. At about 4AM I told her I needed to go home, change out of my uniform, shower, and sleep. She agreed I should go home to rest. We both knew that this would be a loooong road ahead. I walked out to the car and made a few phone calls... And cried. I cried so much I didn't know if I could drive or even if it was safe to drive. Eventually I sobered up a little and made it home. Cried in the shower for about a half hour. My cousin had made it to my home in the flurry of all this to take care of the dogs and button up the house if needed. He waited for me to get home. He said when I walked in the door I looked ""empty."" I guess whenever he kept asking me questions I would just tell him, ""Man... I just don't fucking know.""

&#x200B;

I woke up at 7AM and hurried to the hospital to make rounds. This would be a long day of just waiting around and tests. Blood draws, echocardiogram, doppler tests for DVTs in her legs. There was some times with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. She didn't sleep that night, and spent most of her day between seeing different clinicians napping or eating. We tried to watch Netflix, but she was too tired to keep her attention on anything. She was also having too much difficulty speaking still so conversations were stressful and difficult. She would later tell me it felt like she was trapped inside her own head. She knew what she wanted to tell other people, but simply couldn't get it out. We barely talked to any doctors this day except her neurologist. He was a tall, round man who sounded a bit German. He was very short, but not impolite. That night right at the 24 hour mark she would be getting an MRI on her head. We wouldn't hear the results until the next later afternoon, and it was excruciating. We would see some mild improvements today. She would regain the vast majority of her gross movement skills in her right arm, but her speech was slow and deliberate. Not so confused today, though.

&#x200B;

Day two would be her last day in the ICU. Still basically zero contact with a physician besides the round neurologist. However today was more improvements. She would be able to hold a conversation with our first visitors, and could brush her hair and her teeth for the first time without help. The one thing that did happen that was the most frustrating thing, and when I realized that I was extremely defensive on her behalf, is a friend talked down to her. This person talked slowly and loudly to her as if she was dumb or as if the stroke had made her stupid. Emotions were still high this day. We still cried a lot. I tried to not let this incident bother me.

Day three was a ton of waiting around. She got transferred from the ICU to the Neuro unit this afternoon, but there wasn't enough beds available so we would hang out for a bit longer in the ICU. I did get a chance to pry some info out of the day shift nurse that was assigned to our room in the ICU. He showed me the interpretations of the tests so far. Everything was normal except her echo showed the bubble test was positive for a PFO. Just what we need... Another problem. Soon after we finally got a physician to talk to us! YES! He explained EVERYTHING. Her MRI showed that she had a small ischemic stroke to the left lower basal ganglia. It didn't seem to be severe, but it was there. All of her blood tests were normal. I think we finally ended up being transferred shortly before dinner time. The neuro unit basically only gave her a quick assessment and let her mostly rest most of the night. This was certainly the most sleep either of us got since this all happened. Turns out ICUs are bustling with business all hours of the night. Rest was clearly not a part of their healing regiment, but thankfully we were low on the list of priorities compared to most of the other patients in the unit. We did get a chance to get her a shower the first night in the neuro unit. She walked in a stinky stroke victim, and walked out a less stinky one, but was more happy about the shower than anything else so far.

&#x200B;

Day four would be our most boring, and exciting day yet. She woke up better than ever! We got news early in the day that she might get discharged! PT had signed off on her, OT said she was ready for outpatient stuff, and her speech person also said she was good to go. All we needed was to hear back from the cardiologist regarding her PFO. He said a bunch of stuff and a ton of questions were asked, but basically he told her that surgery was in her near future. It would require to be fixed, but it was not going to require major surgery. It would be outpatient. PHEW! Bullet dodged. About 3 hours later we got discharge papers...

&#x200B;

The last couple of days have been filled with emotional moments. So many times she has told me she never thought we would make it here, and indeed I feel like we've won the lottery. We have a new lease on life, and feel like this has made us stronger than anything ever could have. SHE RODE HER BIKE TODAY... Just up and down the driveway a couple times, but holy cow! How exciting is that?!? Her speech is basically normal, but she has some slurring once in a while and has to remind herself to talk more slowly. Her arm strength has almost entirely resolved. Sometimes she has some issues, but it mostly comes around when she's stressed or tired. Her face... I don't know if it'll ever totally be normal, but her smile to me is the best thing ever. Not long before this I didn't think I'd ever see that smile again, but it creeps up into the corner of her mouth when she truly smiles. The remnants of herself before the stroke are a reminder to me of how lucky she is. It reminds me to hold all of the moments of health and happiness that we have so close and to cherish all the time we share together.

&#x200B;

I apologize for this being a small book, but I think it's important to see this whole cycle. While I was watching her suffer in that bed. Scared, anxious, and unsure of her future. I wanted to give her something to latch onto. My job is to help sick people, but when that sick person was my own I couldn't do anything except barely hold back tears. It is okay to be scared during all this. It is okay to cry. I had to remind myself of all this every single moment of every single day. All of this has forever changed me as an individual, a professional, and a partner.

1fdirts,stroke,1725977316.0,"2 weeks before my 30th birthday, I had a severe ischemic stroke that paralyzed the left side of my body. Over 4 years later, I'm still working on getting movement and strength back in my left arm and hand. 

The stroke unlocked some things that I had buried pretty deep in my subconscious, which completely changed my life. I like to think of it as if it cleared away the cobwebs that were blocking a major life discovery. 

If it wasn't for the stroke, I never would have started taking care of myself, I never would have figured out I was trans and polyamorous, I never would have met my fiance, and I never would have found happiness. 

All of these changes in me resulted from the stroke, either by it clearing away the cobwebs or the perspective it gave me. 

Before the stroke, I was able-bodied, and had a brain that worked, but I was miserable. I was unwilling and unable to change my life for the better. The stroke was the push I needed to make some real changes. 

At first I believed that the stroke ruined my life, and I was severely depressed. I was a victim because I chose to be one. I fought my way out of victimhood and the worst of the depression because someone told me ""your future is still in your control."" 

I also saw this [TedTalk](https://youtu.be/NeZbWaW4bzk?si=NzNda3b4zzYFOH6n) by Linda Rodestad, which inspired me to look for the good in the situation, rather than focus on the bad. That's the thing about life, it's naturally balanced. **There's always good and bad in everything.** 

I know myself better now. I found true love. I learned who my real friends are. I have the power to create a better life.

I continue to recover, physically, over 4 years later. I've become 99% independent. I no longer want my old life back because I'm creating a life I actually love. 

I'm working with vocational rehab on going back to work now that I've got my neuro-fatigue under control. 

So for those who are beginning to lose hope: don't give up. There's no time limit on recovery and there are tons of free resources out there, if insurance gives you problems.

15l9g9q,stroke,1691475066.0,"Hi all, 

I'm posting this because I would have liked something like this for some sort of idea of what to expect right when my mother had her stroke. 

**November 7th, 2022** \- Get a call that my mother is hospitalized, I show up and she is intubated and they describe the type of stroke she has and I am devastated, I'm a nurse so I know what the outcome of a stroke this bad is. 

**November 8th, 2022** \- they do surgery to relieve the pressure from her brain and attached an external drain to her head for the blood and brain fluid to have somewhere to go. She is in ICU and comatose and on a ventilator. 

**November 15th, 2022** \-  they did some trial runs of clamping her drain to see if her body could absorb any of the excess fluid naturally, but she could not. They extubated her and she was able to breathe on her own and would open her eyes and give one word answers, sometimes multiple words. Knows her name, and recognizes some people but is completely confused. 

**November 16th 2022** \- they give the option of another surgery to insert an internal drain to her brain that goes into her stomach to drain the fluid there. I agree to it. They do it, she comes out intubated again.

**November 20th, 2022** \- she is extubated again and is able to breathe on her own. She is awake some of the time but she is a lot more confused now. Does not recognize her family but she is able to say their names. She is in a lot worse condition now, her blood pressure is out of control, she is spiking a fever often, she can't stay awake for long. It was difficult at this stage. 

**November 25th 2022** \- they want to discharge her to a facility that her insurance covers now that she is ""stable"" I decline saying that she is not stable and that I won't consent to the transfer. They keep her and a case worker speaks with me about her case and I list everything out. They agree with me and decide to hold her another day.

**November 26th 2022** \- My mother is beginning to show signs of seizure activity. They do connect a continuous EEG machine on her and it confirms the seizure activity. She is somewhat awake at this point but cannot speak much. Asleep most of the time. 

**November 30th, 2022** \- They get the seizures under control and I am comfortable with the transfer at this point. They transfer her to a facility that her insurance covers (the company I work for) and as soon as she gets there they do an MRI to have a baseline and notice that her brain is still retaining fluid and they do emergency brain surgery. Meanwhile she has a feeding tube in her stomach providing nutrition. 

**December 1st, 2022** \- The surgery went well but her mental status is worse. She's asleep most of the day. Doesn't speak. They have to intubate again. 

**December 5th, 2022** \- We speak to hospice, not my choice, start to figure out what will happen if the worst happens. I know full well what the odds are at this point but I don't tell my family the whole truth, I just let them know that its BAD bad. 

**December 10th, 2022** \- My mother begins to show a little progress. she is extubated. Her blood pressure is still on the high side. Temp still uncontrolled but she seems to be progressing. 

**December 20th 2022**\- My mother is awake about 30 minutes out of every hour during daytime. She is speaking in sentences. Her left side which showed signs of movement at the beginning is completely flaccid now. I buy her a electric glove that opens and closes her left hand to do some therapy with her. 

**December 23rd 2022** \- She is now considered medically stable. BP is under control with three BP meds, no seizure activity, she is on three seizure meds. She is unable to sit up on her own, is completely bed ridden. 

**December 24th 2022** \- My mother is transferred to a nursing home. Those places are terrible. My mother can speak more but cannot sit up on her own. We are working with her every day to do exercises. The staff is not helping much, there are some who care but its rare. 

**January 2nd, 2023** \- Nobody has come in to see my mom since she was admitted. Everyone is off for the holiday break. Some staff are in but very very minimal. She is still on tube feeding. She is more alert, forgets who I am sometimes but then remembers. 

**February 1st, 2023** \- My mother is able to be sat up with back support. She is speaking more but still does not make too much sense when speaking. Still has a feeding tube but she is able to swallow now. Her left side is showing signs of movement. 

**March 1st 2023** \- She is able to sit up on a regular chair. Her left side is able to move a little more. Able to move fingers and toes but cannot lift arm or leg. 

**April 1st 2023-** She can sit up to now still cannot stand but physical therapy gets her up with A LOT of assistance. 

**May 1st 2023** \- She can sit up on her own now with no back support. Can stand with assistance, I am able to get her to take some steps on her own. But her left side is getting a lot more movement.

**June 1st 2023** \- The feeding tube is finally removed although she could eat for several months. After the tube is removed every day she makes progress with strength and being able to walk. 

**July 1st, 2023** \- she is able to take steps with no assistance, very unsteady but can walk 10-15 feet on her own. She is finally discharges home. We have a hospital bed, walker, toilet riser, and showe chair delivered to her home. She needs a lot of diapers.

**August 7th 2023** \- She is mentally like 75% all there. She speaks differently now, like a higher pitch, she says different words. She remembers mostly everything from before the stroke. Still makes up some wild stories that arent true. She can stand on her own and get her walker and walk about. Her left leg is strong and her left arm has strength but not as strong. Her left foot is showing Spastic equinovarus *foot deformity* \- she can fix with when she is mindful but it involuntary curls up like that when she doesnt think about it. 

We did not expect her to be where she is now way back then, there is a long road ahead of her but its incremental progress. For every one step forward it seemed like there were three steps back at the beginning but I am so grateful and happy to still have her and extremely grateful to see her progress. 

It was very hard emotionally. It sometimes makes me sad but then I realize that most people don't get a second chance with their parents like I did. You always hear ""I would give anything if I could just see them one more time"" well... I've had 9 months of one more times. I wish it would have never happened, but it happened. This is my mom now, I love all of her how she is now. I'm looking at all the positives in front of me instead of focussing on the things I can't change or focussing on the things that haven't happened.

I had an ischemic stroke caused by a DVT from a PFO (I miss the days where I had no idea what those acronyms meant). I was completely paralyzed on my left side. I am so thankful for where I am now, but 6 months ago I felt so much more optimistic cause I just kept hearing ‚Äòyou‚Äôre young, you‚Äôll make a full recovery‚Äô. Today, however, I struggle with spasticity that keeps my knee hyperextended, my ankle rolling (and thus in a v cute AFO), and my hand closed (or in a super cute plastic brace for stretching) and non functional. 

I forget a lot of the progress I made and discount it greatly, which I found is common with a lot of survivors from the support groups I‚Äôve been in.

I take every precaution within my control to maintain and improve my health. I can definitely say that my body is in much better condition today than I was at 38. I do it for prevention in addition to give myself a better fighting chance at recovery should it happen again. Learning how to walk again is rough. I still don't have 100% dexterity back in my left hand. 

Since I've changed my lifestyle, my relationships with others has evolved as well. In order to gain and maintain my health, I have changed my nutrition and my relationship with food. It's striking me pretty hard tonight that regardless of my attempts to suggest otherwise with a group of local friends, our socialization revolves around food. I don't mind going out to eat with them sometimes. I know how to make better choices or just order a drink and visit, but I don't want to do that all the time. Offering to host dinner every time isn't realistic. 

To meet more people and join with people who have interests outside of eating at restaurants, I've been brainstorming other activities. I thought about hiking. Solo travel. Guitar lessons. There's the catch. 

My left hand is functional, but I think that I'd have to have a very patient and understanding instructor who knows how to work with that limitation. On the other hand, I do believe that trying will help my dexterity improve.

I've been following this subreddit since my mother had a stroke two and a half years ago. Because she suffers from aphasia, I frequently read this sub to understand the challenges she goes through but cannot express, helping me to be more empathetic.

Lately, I've noticed some members who seem hopeless and desperate. I want to share my mother's recovery process to offer hope and encouragement.

The Initial Crisis

My mother had severe bleeding in her brain and underwent surgery. The doctors had very little hope for her survival. She stayed in the ICU for weeks, showing no signs of recovery for a long time.

She had a tracheostomy, and we fed her through a hole in her stomach. She was unconscious, didn't recognize us, and was like a baby for a long time. Her entire right side was paralyzed; she couldn't chew or swallow. She wore diapers, and we had to wash and clean her. We took care of her like this for 5-6 months.

 The Struggle and Acceptance

We thought this would be our life moving forward. We were tired and depressed, but we accepted the situation and were willing to care for her as a family. We hired a physiotherapist, but initially, my mom couldn't even sit still. We were overjoyed when she first moved her finger - it felt like a milestone.

The Slow Progress

She was like a baby. After months of therapy, we celebrated every small victory:
- When she managed to sit up
- When she could move her fingers and legs
- When she was able to use the toilet by herself

The Remarkable Recovery

Now, her progress amazes us:
- She can cook and prepare meals herself
- She can walk freely
- We regularly FaceTime each other. While we can't communicate with words, we somehow understand each other
- We laugh, sing, and frequently go out to dinner together
- She can move her right arm, though it doesn't function normally
- She's receiving speech therapy and can utter some words

Caregivers..

I know how hard it is to take care of a paralyzed human being, but don't lose hope. Always smile at your patient, be helpful, and don't hesitate to ask for help from others. Be patient. Over time, your stress will reduce, and you'll be proud of yourself and your loved one. I witnessed this entire process, and even though I was the most hopeless at first, I've seen incredible progress happen.

Remember, recovery is possible. Stay strong, and keep believing in the power of care, love, and rehabilitation.",https://v.redd.it/zgq37ohspbed1,some hope for you,,49,15,0.98

There were many other things, but after a month and one day, they let him go home. After 2 weeks of rehab, he was able to walk, and had no mobility problems at all. 

He started eating again, after struggling with food because of the taste and the texture. Right now, he‚Äôs able to eat his favorite food again, and started gaining weight after losing almost 10kg. 

He has Broca‚Äôs aphasia, and started therapy right after he got out of the hospital. I‚Äôm still amazed by all the improvement he has made, he still struggles with remembering the name of objects, but after months of not being able to talk we are now having conversations again. 

I mentioned in my post that I missed him, and I just wanted to say it gets a lot better. We are watching movies again, he started The Office for the second time. As I‚Äôm writing this, he‚Äôs telling us about the Christmas decorations he wants for the house this year. 

There are a lot of things that have improved, and other things that are still very difficult, but it‚Äôs getting a lot better. I just wanted to say that I felt hopeless, and this community helped me a lot with understanding everything that was happening. 

I also wanted to say thank you to the people that talked to me on my previous post, specifically this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/pd3jf2/i_miss_my_dad/haplucw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3), because it made me feel a lot better, it does get better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/qxovvp/a_happy_update/,A happy update,,47,12,1.0

I thought it would be neat to write something again, on the anniversary of the day where the next morning was in question, where odds were defied and where I eventually arose, a befuddled, less than dexterous phoenix.. who probably smelled like a barnyard. (Pre-post note: stench was due to being bedridden/hooked up to every machine known to mankind with suboptimal sponge baths for way to long‚Ä¶.really)

For those whom are interested in the first post, you can find it below

 https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/s/sLMWUaCdEB

I have been thinking about what to write for a few months.  Stroke is not something that any of us would ever celebrate, but surviving it, pushing past its unwanted interventions is something that should be heralded.  I find that I always get very subdued when the 25th of October comes around.  I think it‚Äôs the reminder of what could have been and what was.  That little voice of uncertainty pipes up and reminds me that tomorrow is uncertain.  I mean, it always was, but now that uncertainty has a name, a face, and a history with me.  I find the dichotomy weird; I celebrate a day that also brings a touch of sadness.  I recognize that I gained an appreciation of something only because something else was stripped away.

This may or may not resonate with you, the reader.  Whether you be a survivor or a care giver, we have all faced stroke.  We have either lost, or watched someone lose something.  For the lucky ones, it may just be the innocence of mortality, for others, physical or mental abilities, for the truly unfortunate ones, it is the life of someone who was dear.  I truly wish this wasn‚Äôt the case.  We have all been impacted by something horrible.  I understand when people write that they wished that they hadn‚Äôt survived their event,  because for a while I felt the same way.

I have not been shy talking about my struggles with depression brought on by the stroke.  I have tried to be open about all parts of my journey because a) I have worked hard to get here, and b) I feel that everyone reading this can benefit from my story.  We all have dealt with or are dealing with sadness and confusion around this topic.  The internet throws out way to much information that doesn‚Äôt help us deal with the now.  What I find incredible is how many survivors post here and try to add some light to the darkness.  We cannot answer questions because having been through it, we understand that the medical professionals have to be the ones to provide the pertinent information.   

Stroke is indiscriminate.  It does not care about what you got going on, but those of us who are going through or have gone through this terrible journey do.  We can‚Äôt make promises, but we can listen and offer kindness.  Most importantly, we can offer hope.  5 years ago today I statistically should have died.  While I have deficiencies, I am able to live my life, and after some time, laugh at some of the speed bumps.  It took a lot to get me where I am today, an incredible medical team, a wife and parents whom I can only describe as legendary, family and friends who have been there since day 1, and a whole lot of luck.  I do not mean to downplay my own work,  but maybe I‚Äôll save that for ‚Äú6 Years ago‚Äù.

The journey has not been easy, but it was incredibly worth it.  Today I am a 5 year survivor, a verbose, less befuddled, marginally more dexterous but definitely better smelling phoenix.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/17g7dga/5_years_ago/,5 Years Ago,Survivor Discussion ,43,26,0.96

Instead, take the entire report and cut and paste it into a AI tool like ChatGPT, Gemini, or something similar. It will translate the entire report into much easier to understand language. Furthermore, you can then ask questions of the AI... Most questions it will say defer to your neurologist, which is totally fine.

However, once you understand the stroke, what caused it, what was discovered, you can ask the neurologist better questions sooner. You can also print out the revised information for the PT/OT people.

We were discharged with a rx for Tamiflu and anti-nausea meds and sent home. Later that night he got much worse and couldn't walk on his own. I took him to the ER and we saw a separate PA. The nurse couldn't understand what he was saying, so obviously there is something wrong. I had to wheel him in a wheelchair. He's never used a wheelchair. The PA told us it was vertigo from the flu, gave him more anti-nausea meds, and sent us home, even after asking him if he was sure it was OK to go home. He told us to wait it out and if he still couldn't walk, to come in on FRIDAY (it was Tuesday morning). We went home, I tried to make him as comfortable as possible and we went to bed. Wednesday morning he's still in bad shape, so I took him to see a different doctor at his doctor's office.

I‚Äôll start by saying I fully recognize that my stroke pales compared to what others have had to experience. Still, it was very real to me, and the fear and uncertainty were almost paralyzing on top of the physical issues.

My story:

On Tuesday, November 3, 2020, I woke up with tingling from left shoulder to fingertips and left hip to toes. I had trouble walking and using my arm. I determined that I slept wrong last night and pinched a nerve. I went through the rest of the day the best I could and went to bed thinking everything would be fine in the morning. I woke up Wednesday feeling even worse than I did the day before and figured I should probably get checked out. Note: For at least 15 years prior to this I had considered myself healthy and decided there was no need to go to the doctor. So I never did.

When I arrived at the ER, I was the only patient there. They asked me about my medical history, and I told them there was none. I‚Äôd never been sick; there was nothing to report. After taking my blood pressure at 223/123 things started to get real. The room I was in sprung into action. There were people everywhere. Much of that experience is blurred in my mind, but I remember many exams, tests, drugs, questions, scans, etc. The fear of what I had done to myself really started to set in when they took me to the ICU, and I became terrified for my life. After spending 5 days in the hospital, it was determined I had no cognitive defects, no slurred speech, and no vision issues. My deficiencies were all located in my left limbs. I did not have diabetes or any heart issues. I did have high blood pressure, was severely obese at 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 250 pounds, and might have sleep apnea. I have always been a non-smoker and non-drinker. I was released to in-patient therapy for 10 days and then sent home with outpatient therapy lined up.

As of July 16, 2021:

I have spent the time since coming home on November 20

\- listening to my doctors,

\- researching what I could online,

\- being more active,

\- getting stronger,

\- eating better,

\- losing weight,

\- grateful for my lifelong Faith in God,

\- and enjoying a new perspective on practically everything.

I am down from 250 to 175 lbs, BP is rountinely 115/75, stronger than I have been in quite some time, more rested than ever, only taking 1 BP med, 1 Cholesterol med, and one asprin. My doctors, OT, and PT have all said they don‚Äôt want to see me again, except for my annual physical. As a bonus, I went shopping for a whole new wardrobe as I needed to replace my XXL shirts with mediums, and 42 pants with 32‚Äôs.

I still have a lot to learn about nutrition and exercise. I still have some personal goals I want to reach as far as my left side is concerned, but I‚Äôm taking everything one day at a time and trying to learn something new along the way.

As I mentioned at the top. My experience pales in comparison to what many have experienced. I recognize fully that for whatever reason, I was lucky and incredibly blessed as it could have been so much worse. I wouldn‚Äôt wish a stroke on anyone, but looking back on it, I am incredibly grateful as I don‚Äôt think I would have woken up to my poor life decisions if it hadn‚Äôt been for November 3.

Please know that while I‚Äôm not an expert on anything, I am happy to share any encouragement, prayers, and amateur advice on what to learn more about for anyone interested.

TLDR: Stroke on 11/3/2020. 7.5 months later, I feel better now than I have in over a decade.

Last week, I went to a pain management Dr with Brian,  hubby, and he basically said he was too contracted to help anymore. That there was no nothing they could do for him except pain management however if I was able to not be homeless and took him out of the nursing home, they would discontinue the norcos. 
Brian looked at me while we waited for his transport, told me he is tired, and asked to just let him go when it's time.

Well, he did.
On the 5 hour drive home, I prayed and prayed just to speak to my dad one last time and tell him how much I love him.
Somehow, he was conscious after the surgery. We spoke loving words (his were quite slurred and forced, but so beautiful last words to me).

This convo gave my mom and sister hope that he was going to make a miraculous recovery.
But I knew what it was. He knew. It was the last time.
The next day, the swelling began setting in- and we never got him conscious again. For 15 days they tried.
Eventually, the experts told us it was just artificial. That he‚Äôd never emerge from vegetative state.
We pulled all vents and he died within 12 hours.
 
I am broken, devastated beyond belief.
But relieved. Watching my hero suffer made me feel so sad for him. So sorry for him.

When someone has a stroke, brain cell death occurs. Because of this cell death, that part of the brain can‚Äôt communicate with the muscles or other areas of the brain effectively. **This can result in a disruption in the way we think, make it difficult for us to speak, or limit our arm and leg movement.**  The surrounding area of the brain has to find alternative pathways to more effectively communicate.             


**Neuroplasticity in a nutshell.**    


So how do we encourage the brain to find and create these alternative pathways?

skzoo2,stroke,1644040650.0,My husband (age 33) had a hemorrhagic stroke last June while I was 7 months pregnant with our first baby. He had blood in his brain that was taking up about 25% in his brain and had to go into surgery to remove the blood. He was paralyzed on the left side of his body and through physical and occupational therapy he was been able to regain some movement. I've had a hard time through all of this since I was pregnant and now postpartum. I'm his main caregiver and also caring for our baby. Most days are hard.

I'm a survivor, 4 years post-stroke. I had no risk factors. All my tests revealed no other underlying risk factors. My hematologist has speculated that it might have been related to COVID because it occurred one month after the lockdown in NYC, where I had been working until that time. When I was admitted to the hospital for surgery to remove the clot causing my ischemic stroke, I tested negative for COVID, but the tests weren't as accurate then as they got to be. So who knows.

As all survivors know, the most frustrating and scary things about this seems to be living with the possibility that it can happen again anytime. We can do what we can to make it less probable, but we can't make it impossible.

Well guess what!? She now has movement in that side! Very very slight but it's there and improving day by day, which is fantastic considering it was 3 months with nothing at all from that side.

v124at,stroke,1653922889.0,"1. It is important to choose an advocate for the survivor. This person should be prepared to complete the following tips.

2. Be well informed and do a lot of research. A lot of the time a billion different words are thrown around to the point that caregivers/families have no idea what is going on. Imagine how the survivor feels. Memory is often an issue with survivors so taking the time to truly understand what issues they‚Äôre facing will make it easier for you to explain to the survivor what happened to them. 

3. Take note of everything that happened (procedures, complications, medications etc.) because the survivor may need a crash course in their treatment post stroke. 

4. Get a copy of medical records after discharge. Even if you plan to stay within the hospital system to receive continued treatment, you never know, and it‚Äôs good to have imaging, reports, and notes on hand. This also helped me to show my survivor where the damage is and why it‚Äôs causing certain issues. 

5. Be prepared to be incredibly patient. They will forget things but try to be patient and gently review things with them again and again. They have gone through alot and will often have anxiety after a stroke, so making sure they understand what is going on helps to give them back some control. This is where tips 1-4 really come into play. Having patience with them while you explain these difficult things empowers them, and helps them to explain their history to new healthcare providers. 

6. Ask for permission to do anything. Even as their caregiver I find it easier to respect their changing boundaries by asking anytime I want to help with something. This way they can pick and choose their boundaries and I can learn which battles they will often choose to fight. Obviously don‚Äôt allow them to put themselves in harms way but at times helping a survivor to do something isn‚Äôt as helpful as we‚Äôd like to think it is. 

7. For caregivers: open up the floor for criticism. The new change in dynamic is new and difficult for anyone involved. I found it helpful to check in and ask for feed back pretty often. As I previously mentioned boundaries are rapidly changing as they recover more, and I like to make sure they have an opportunity to tell me if I am doing something that makes them uncomfortable, or if there is something I can do to help that I‚Äôm not doing. This is hard but it‚Äôs important to make sure they are encouraged to voice their concerns. I often also ask if they‚Äôre still okay with me being their caregiver. 

8. Shared calendars help tremendously. I put all my survivor appointments on a calendar he can access on his phone so he always knows what‚Äôs going on. This also gives them some autonomy to plan things on their own. I just ask that my survivor put it in the calendar so I can be in the know. Likewise, I put all of my plans in the shared calendar as well so my survivor knows when to expect me to be out for a bit. 

9. Check in on  their goals frequently. The goal is often to recover as much as possible, but the survivor might have something that is more important to them. For example, my survivor really wanted to be able to communicate better when they came home, so this helped me to pick the ‚Äúmost important discipline to focus on.  They‚Äôre often easily fatigued so knowing what is the most important allows you to help them prioritize exercises on a day that they a fatigued or having lower motivation. 

10. Accept them where they are at and try to not set expectations for them. This one just helps to make sure you‚Äôre always pleasantly surprised, recovery is incredibly unpredictable. 

11. Point out the improvements! Try to use practical examples like ‚Äúit took you 1 hour to get ready a month ago now you can do it in 20 minutes‚Äù or ‚ÄúI had to do this thing for you before and now you can do it on your own.‚Äù

For now these are something‚Äôs I‚Äôve learned being a primary caregiver 5 months out. Obviously I‚Äôm still learning but I wish I knew some of theses things from the beginning.

oj5zr8,stroke,1626142323.0,"Back when I was 31 I had a right side CVA (bleed) that left me with the usual left side control issues, 11 years later I'm still pretty bad off at a glance to most people but there are so many seemingly trivial milestones that made so much difference in my life since the days of a stroke rehab hospital.

Since my insurance covers a gym membership through silver sneakers I joined a nearby gym with a pool & started walking in the water there after giving up on my foot falling off the pedals of the exercise bikes.  The resistance of the water alone would have been a huge help years ago when I was (barely) walking with a cane, but it didn't take long for me to start looking on amazon & such for resistance cuffs for my ankles.  [These](https://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAFGFCJLTDRD/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HPBTNK9) turned out to be an incredible solution for me & after a few months of building up with the medium resistance ones I can do 1-2 hours a day with my heartrate up the whole time &  looking forward to getting the next step up soon.

I wanted to throw a party the day I managed to step>move cup>step>repeat to get a cup of coffee to my computer unaided years back.  Then again I saw a lot of gradual improvement in hard to describe areas when I made my way up to walking without a cane, but eventually there was a wall where progress seemed to be done.  Walking forward/backwards/left/right with the fins has been improving my foot placement & building muscle in my legs to help with things like not having my foot fall off my knee when putting on socks & such because I can keep it in place with muscles instead of mere hope & luck.

With the water's resistance to slow/support me & take most of the weight off my ankles I can push myself much harder than  I could dream of doing outside of the pool & I'm seeing real progress again thanks to the muscle building & nerves waking up with the fins without the joint pain & sore muscles I used to associate with exercise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/oj5zr8/exercise_after_a_stroke_yes_its_possible/,Exercise after a stroke (yes it's possible!),,37,11,0.96
nky34h,stroke,1621971351.0,"I'm brand new to this but I'm going to share my story for insight and perhaps learn something new. Also excuse my inevitable typos. 

On October 3rd 2019 I had a massive stroke. At 7 pm I was at work and I felt my left side go numb. I left work and drove myself home after looking up my symptoms Google said I was having a stroke but I thought I was being silly. By 1am it was obvious what was happening and my fiance saw it and rushed me and the children into the van because our ambulance was not equipped to handle stroke victims. I did not know it at the time but my body had shut down and I had spoiled myself and defecated. I remember him calling 911 and getting permission to speed to the nearest hospital. Then my memory have out. 

So what happened after my memory gave out was I became lethargic 15 minutes after arriving to the hospital and it was obviously I had a bleed in my brain so I had to be life flighted. It was too foggy so they took me by ambulance to a bigger hospital with my chance of survival at 3% I immediately went in for brain surgery. After I successfully came out another bleed developed and I had to go back in. This time my chance of survival was 1% and if I came out of it I was going to be preeminent paralyzed and brain dead. 

Well somehow I pulled threw with an unexpected full recovery. I was in a coma for a bit and it was during this it was discovered I was pregnant with our fourth child. I was in the hospital for two months. 

Allot of crazy things happened when I was hospitalized. Not only did I have to relearn basic things but also grow a baby and on top of that the actions of those around me when they thought I was dying was atrocious. My fiance saved my life and had been my rock threw everything including this and we don't keep things from each other. On day two of retraining my memory I new something was wrong and that's when it all came out. 

So I lost my best friend when she decided to date my father. Her and I grew up together and I was disgusted. I never told them how I felt I just stopped speaking to her. My father hated my fiance but never let it be known until Istroke. Together my father and friends tried to get the doctors to abort my baby, told my children I was going to die, tried to take my children and my paychecks to support my family. They threatened and tried to send others over to ""take care""of my fiance and put my children in danger. When my fiance found out he took the children to victim services to be questioned and evaluated by doctors. They set up a safe house for him and the children as I was fighting for my life. When it was discovered that I was going to live they back peddled and threatened to kill my fiance if he told me.

I spent two months in silence ensuring their visits and waiting for them to tell me their side of the story but it never came. My fiance backed up everything with proof so I knew they lied bad. When I got out I told them u knew and cut them off entirely. It's 2021 now and my left hand doesn't work and I can walk with a cane but my brain has a hard time retaining memory. I did all this on my own. 

My son was born happy and healthy and I do my best to raise the kids half paralyzed. I do get help but at first it was hard cuz I removed most people from my life. I lost my job but I did alright mentally until now. I think I'm starting to show symptoms of ptsd. I'm not retaining memory much anymore and I spiral frequently. I hold it together for the children but I'm tired. I'm used to doing things for myself but now I have to rely on others and it's triggering In so many ways I can't cope. I start seeing a therapist for the first time next week cuz I finally reached the point where I can no longer deal with my mental state alone. Idk.

A neurologist gave me a terrible medication that interacted with 2 others I was taking (anxiety and blood pressure) caused a blood clot that led to a stroke. My stroke went undiagnosed because my family thought I was overreacting due to the vision changes I had been suffering from weeks prior due to this same medication that my pa said surely wasn‚Äôt causing this.

nxb3xb,stroke,1623400734.0,"With the world starting to open back up there are more chances to run into jerks out on the streets. I had a situation yesterday where I was sitting in my mothers car in a parking lot as she went in a store to pick up food on our way back from physical therapy. A man pulls up next to us and gets out with his family, his door hits my door. Not really hard, but it was hard enough to notice it as I heard it while sitting inside. I ignored it, but then he goes back in his car and does it again. Now I'm not the type of person to start a fight, but I'm also not the type of son to let you hit my mothers car twice with your door without saying something.

So I roll down the window and I ask him to be careful, you keep hitting my car with your door. Of course he does what you would think someone who would hit your car door would do, he goes through a laundry list of excuses and justifications instead of being decent by apologizing, being mindful of other people and going about your day. At that point I had a hard time communicating because of the spasticity in my cheek and I had to repeat myself twice so I wanted to end the conversation. Then I just simply asked him if there was a scratch there because I physically couldn't look down to see, that's when he just went off.

He started screaming right next to my window just being belligerent and I was genuinely confused how someone can be so hostile over something so little. So I didn't say anything and just stared at him as he walked away screaming obscenities to himself as if I really just somehow offended him by pointing out he keeps hitting my car with his door.

It wasn't until after the altercation that I realized that I put myself in a really vulnerable position, i'm not sure if he realized I was disabled, but he could have easily lunged at me through the window in his bout of rage. I'm 35 and I've always been able to handle myself, I don't start fights but I've never backed down from one in my entire life and for the first time I was suddenly aware of my mortality, strangely more in that moment then when I had my stroke.

Now this guy was 5'10 260 lbs, he wasn't a muscular guy but you can tell it wasn't all fat. I wasn't scared in the moment, what I felt was disappointment and shame, I came to the realization that I couldn't protect myself and more importantly I couldn't protect those I cared for anymore. This has mentally been weighing on me ever since that happened yesterday afternoon. I feel weak and helpless but I don't want to live my life walking on egg shells hoping I don't run into a monster.

Everyone notices our physical disabilities, but no one ever shines a light on the mental toll suddenly becoming disabled takes on you. What has become painfully obvious this past year since I've had my stroke is that this world doesn't cater to the disabled as much as you think and it certainly doesn't slow down for a second.

PS. The ironic part, he stood there in front of his car the whole time waiting for me to leave and as we pulled away I saw him check his door to see if I did something to it, of course I did nothing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/nxb3xb/i_had_my_first_altercation_today_as_a_stroke/,I had my first altercation today as a stroke survivor,,35,19,0.97
nre67c,stroke,1622728753.0,"So pre-stroke I was able to learn and remember things with very little effort. Info went in and was basically on demand without needing to document details or practice a skill too much. I could retain that knowledge for a long while...years In many cases...without revisiting it. 

Since the stroke I find I can't retain details for any length of time. A week at most. Which at work is proving to be a struggle. I've never been a good note taker because I never needed that skill. But now if I don't document something so I can review it...that info is just gone.

l5t6uc,stroke,1611711406.0,"First of all, I am not a medical professional. I am a survivor, still trying to recover. I want to give advice to those who may have had a stroke, recently.

Firstly, it's normal to feel a brain fog after a stroke, I felt that way for around a year. My brain works almost perfectly now (except, obviously, controlling my left side). So, don't feel to frightened, it's normal.

Secondly, listen to your therapists! I cannot stress this enough. Did you go to school to study therapy and the body? No? Then be quiet and listen!

Thirdly, you should be able to get a personal tens machine. I got this one: https://www.mdsupplies.com/medical-supplies-Dr-Franklyns-Digital-Muscle-Stimulator-EMS-M612SXSSK4.html

You can use it to stimulate your arm or leg. It should help your muscles ""wake up"".

Fourthly, speaking of waking up, don't rush recovery. I tried that and it was a bad idea. I got to a point where I could stand by myself, as well as transfer myself, and use the restroom, I only needed help in the bath. I felt hopeful, I went home early, had a fall, broke my good leg, and go im unable to stand at all. Don't rush, whatever you do. You're on recoveries schedule, now.

Lastly, im fairly young, I was 29 when my stroke happened, so, this is information for younger folks. I used to play video games a lot. Can't so much now. But, there is hope! A electronic engineer and frequent modder named Ben Heck makes one handed controllers! I have the Xbox One version, but he just recently released a ps4 version, too. This is some hope, I still cannot play certain games. Racing, fighting, fps games, they're all out. Rpgs are my jam, now, though. I also play games on my phone, the same one I am typing this message on, actually. Phone games are nice, because the touch controls are usually one handed.

I hope this has been helpful for other survivors. So far, my early 30's have not been to fun. I miss driving the most, though. I for I heal, though I hear it's a small overall chance, my therapist has said being younger should help my chances.

Apologies for any spelling errors. Im usually very good with grammar. I went to college for an English Literature degree. Lot of good that's doing me now, though.

1bm7gq3,stroke,1711239770.0,"On Sunday, March 3, 2024, at 1:10pm, I had a severe ischemic thalamic stroke. I am 40 years old.  A miracle of timing and TPA, I am recovering with no deficits. 

I was sitting at my computer working on a presentation for work when I suddenly had pressure in the middle of my forehead, and it felt like I was going through a tunnel at 100 mph. I called for husband right away, he laid me down; when I covered one eye, I could see fine but with both eyes open, I was cross-eyed. He called 911 and laid me down on the couch as we waited for the ambulance. I suddenly got very tired, but my eyesight was better. The EMTs came, took my vitals, and found my neuro checks and blood pressure were fine. They didn‚Äôt think I was having a stroke, but my husband insisted I go to the hospital. He even beat the ambulance and I arrived at the hospital at 1:45pm, met by a team of 8 nurses and doctors who worked so hard to save my life. From there, I only have snippets of my memories. I remember feeling them putting me in the machines, I remember the million neuro checks that I couldn‚Äôt stay awake for; I was told my speech was nonsensical, but my blood pressure was fine. I could easily lift my left side when asked but I would fall asleep; my husband had to scream in my right ear and tell me to lift my right arm or leg (which I did, but then I would fall asleep again). They assessed me as a 24 on the NIH stroke scale (sometimes I was a 28 because I was waxing and waning so much). After the CT showed no results, they gave me an MRI with contrast. By pure luck, they found the stroke in the artery of Percheron, located in the Thalamus in the middle of my brain.  This is a hard area to find on an MRI and I am incredibly lucky they found it when they did. This is a small artery that had branches to both sides of my brain (mostly impacted the left side of my brain, but a small part on the right, which is why I couldn‚Äôt stay awake). At 2:59pm, I was given the miracle TPA drug. When I was being wheeled from the ED to the ICU at 4;30pm, I started regaining my functions. My husband knew the drug was working because my speech became clear and I was waking up. By the time I was at the ICU, I was fully awake and aware, and within a half hour, they assessed me again. I was a 0 on the stroke scale. The medicine worked. I had no deficits. Once the 6 hours post TPA was gone, I could walk around, and my physicality was normal. I felt normal, like nothing happened. I got to see my boys and communicate with them, to relieve them of their panic and concern. My husband was able to breathe again; he saved my life with his quick thinking. 

For the next few days, I had a myriad of tests. I had an echocardiogram performed, which came back normal. I was moved to the neuro floor, where I had a trans esophageal echocardiogram, which shows I have a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO), a birth defect which basically means I have a hole in my heart. Once that was found, an ultrasound on my legs, an MRI/MRV,, a CT with contrast on my pelvis and abdomen. Since I have a PFO, the clot most likely came from below my heart. My brain and heart look good, and they found no source of clotting in the rest of my body. I was discharged after four days in the hospital with a a cardiac monitor I get to wear for 30 days, baby aspirin and a statin and no outpatient PT.  From here, I will meet with the neuro team in 6 weeks to go over the results of my cardiac monitor and if nothing is found, I will be referred to cardiology where we will discuss whether to close the PFO (I would very much like to have it closed, please).

The only residual impact of the stroke is my mental health. I will feel waves of fatigue and short-term memory lapses for a while, but they should resolve on their own, with time. Every doctor and nurse, with experience 5-30 years each, told me they have never seen this before. They have never seen someone go from a 24 to a 0 in 1.5 hours, which is because of the TPA. The head of the stroke team said very excitedly ‚Äúthis is why I get up every day!‚Äù. I learned later that same doctor told his team he was excited about my stroke, because in his 20+ years, he has never been able to catch a stroke of the artery of Percheron and use the TPA effectively (glad I could help out, doc lol). The overwhelming feeling of what could have happened and what a miracle it is of what happened has been a lot. My fatigue is still bad. I already live with chronic back and pelvis pain, and I feel the pain is worse now. 

I am extremely lucky, I know this. I read all the stories here and am watching your journeys and struggles, and I know I won't be as lucky next time. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1bm7gq3/tpa_is_a_miracle_drug/,TPA is a miracle drug ,,35,27,0.97

My wife gave birth to our son at term. After spending 5 days in the clinique we went home as everything was fine according doctors.

  
When my son had 15 days, we woke up at night when he was crying at the same tone, looking very pale and having his eyes looking at oposite directions. We called ambulance but doctor on phone said that it should be fine (when I said that he didnt vomit/didnt have fever). The doctor came to our place in around 7 hours and said that most likely it is meningite and called ambulance.

In the hospital nurses gave him antibiotics and my baby went to a scanner. There was a bleeding (no infection) in his head and it blocked the drainage of celebral liquide.

He went through 8 operations since that day, after one of operation he got shunt infected so he had meningite.  
Now he is 4 months old. Almost 3 months he spent in the hospital. We already see that he is late in his developement.

Doctors said that the bleeding is not labor related (I have doubts) and it just happened without a reason. Baby did not fall or anything, he came in term so I can not believe that ""it just happened"".

If I had been paralyzed and unable to walk people would be amazed and so happy for me if after 16-17 years I was suddenly able to walk.  I am having a very different experience after my sudden recovery from my significant memory issues. 

I have come to realize that it is due to 1 of 2 reasons.

\#1. They never truly believed or understood the serious memory issues I have been dealing with. Having any kind of mental issue is still so taboo in society that people never wanted to talk about it or understand it.  My ex was the worst, believing that I was just lazy, and I am sure she shared her opinion with our 3 kids, friends neighbors, people at church, and everyone she knew. 

\#2 They don't understand the life-changing impact this has had on my life, or they just don't want to talk about it. Being able to go to the store without a list or sending myself a text is amazing. 

I am happy and thankful for what has happened, and that is enough.  I never wanted to make anyone uncomfortable, but I did hope to share/celebrate this life-changing news.  I had to suffer internally for 16-17 years, so I will celebrate internally...and with everyone here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/140mxeb/people_just_dont_understand_or_are_uncomfortable/,People just don't understand or are uncomfortable.,,33,7,1.0

10siq6k,stroke,1675425867.0,"My husband is in the ICU after life saving surgery. I just need someone to give me some hope. The doctors are very harsh.


Almost 3 weeks ago everything changed. I am writing this from my husband‚Äôs ICU room. 

My husband (M,32) and I (F,32) got married at 21 years old. Next month it‚Äôll be 12 years. He was diagnosed with hypertension when he was 19 years old before I met him. 

His blood pressure has always been a problem. He‚Äôs been on medication most of his life. His BP problems are always a source of anxiety for him. He never let me check it at home. And whenever we would go to a doctor even if it was for nothing or just a simple check up, his anxiety would shoot up and in turn that would make his BP shoot up. So he hated it. 

On the 15th of this month, it was a normal day for us. We spent most of the day in bed with our cats watching movies. Around 9 pm he goes to the kitchen to make a smoothie for dinner. A few minutes later he comes back to the room telling me he doesn‚Äôt feel good and he needs to sit down. I asked him if we need to go somewhere and get help and he immediately said yes. That‚Äôs when I knew something must be seriously wrong because he‚Äôs not the type to admit when somethings wrong or ask for help. 

To make a long story a bit shorter, we ended up in the ER and by morning the cardiologist was called and we were informed that he is suffering from aortic dissection and that he needs life saving open heart surgery. 

The following week is honestly a blur. I didn‚Äôt realize in the beginning the severity of his situation. I now know that the surgeons and doctors had given him a 5% chance of making it out of surgery. His BP was up and down. Infection numbers up and down. Fever up and down. 

When they started reducing sedation it became clear that there is a neurological issue. He just wasn‚Äôt waking up the way he should be. When they did an MRI they found small strokes in his brain. I was told to be thankful that it‚Äôs not one big stroke. I‚Äôm being told a lot of things. 

The second week was spent stabilizing him. They performed a tracheotomy(?) and out in a feeding tube for long term support. Also the team of doctors were and still are trying to figure out the right medicines for him. 

We‚Äôre in week 3 now. It‚Äôs been 18 days. Every day feels like a year. His situation now is this: the surgery was successful. His heart is doing well. His lungs are doing well. Most of his internal organs are doing well. The kidney function has been mostly good but it fluctuates sometimes as they change his medicine. His BP is still not completely stable but it is improving. His temperature still fluctuates a bit but not too much. I‚Äôm told it could be a central neurological issue because they haven‚Äôt found a source for infection. 
The main issue they‚Äôre facing is that when they reduce the sedation he gets agitated and his BP and RR go up and then they have to sedate him again. 
It‚Äôs actually getting better very slowly. When he‚Äôs awake he‚Äôs not as agitated and his BP isn‚Äôt getting as high as it used to. 

They all tell me it‚Äôs about time. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a marathon not a sprint‚Äô is what I keep hearing. And that‚Äôs fine. My life is his. I will spend it all taking care of him. I just want someone to tell me he‚Äôs going to be ok. 

The doctors are not optimistic. They keep saying that his recovery is going to be long and hard (which ok fine I‚Äôll take that) and that he may never be the same again. And I understand that. Of course he‚Äôs not gonna be the same. He fought for his life. But they tell me he may never talk the same or walk right or think normally ever again. And I just can‚Äôt accept that. I can‚Äôt. He‚Äôs the most intelligent, kindest, sweetest, best human I‚Äôve ever met. And I know people say that but I‚Äôm not just saying it because he‚Äôs my love. He really really is. He‚Äôs strong and smart and powerful. I just refuse these worst case scenarios that the doctors are pushing. In the same breath they say these things they also tell me that they just don‚Äôt know and can‚Äôt guess until he‚Äôs fully alert. 

I know about brain plasticity and that the brain is so amazing that we barely understand it. Idrk what I‚Äôm asking here. I just feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind and I keep ping ponging between faith and fear. I‚Äôm just so scared. Can someone just give me some hope?

1ezsvv8,stroke,1724460768.0,"Hey everyone, 
Sorry this is a little long and iin posting near when I go to sleep, so I might not reply to anybody who replys until tomorrow morning. 

I (28 F) had a stroke in June and and a tia in July. I have multiple chronic illnesses and mental illness, and a pacemaker (which made it take two months for me to get an mri, because I have an abandoned lead from an old pacemaker). I haven't been working for several months due to all the shit I'm my life and the stroke just piled on top. I'm insanely fatigued from the stroke. I already have chronic fatigue, but this is a whole new level. 

The increasing severity dawned on me yesterday when I had to go out and do maybe half a days worth (if that) of normal human things. I was completely drained by 2pm. The fatigue was so overwhelming it took a huge amount of willpower to do anything; I didn't eat dinner since I used my remaining energy to feed my animals and take my dog outside. Today, I woke and I felt just as I had yesterday evening. I took a nap this afternoon, and when I woke up I truly thought I was going to have to call someone because I thought I wouldn't be able to move with assistance.

My worry is financial and functional. I am already on disability; I was before I had the stroke. I'm working with an organization that helps people fundraise and manage finances while they are participating in programs like disability, which limit your assets. Since I stopped working at a young age I paid just enough to qualify for ssdi. My monthly benefits from ssdi are under $500, once the premiums for parts b and c of medicare are deducted. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to be receiving any money. My patches will not provide any support, and I've made my world small. I've become more isolated due to the illnesses that I deal with, both physical and mental. 

I'm in a lot of debt since I haven't been working; and the amount I receive from diability is not enough to even cover rent. I need to work, at least part time, so I can afford to live at all. I just don't know how to do it with this level of fatigue. I've been applying for remote positions, which is the ideal situation. But for as many jobs that are out there, very few people are hiring. I've sent out at least 70 applications in the past two months and I've gotten one response. I'm not a shining star applicant, or anything; but I have a college degree and tailor my resume and cover letter for each job application. 

Any suggestions or tips regarding organizations that offer financial assistance for cost of living (ie. Rent, phone bill, utilities), tips on jobs or how to find jobs that are fatigue friendly, any equipment or practice which you've found that helps with your fatigue (but I swear if one of you says yoga...), or anything else, it would be greatly appreciated. 

I do have a service dog, named Acacia, to help with autism symptoms that are mostly anxiety and depression related. This is a photo of her.

It's one of those days today, and I‚Äôm feeling a bit down in the dumps. The biggest kicker for me has been losing my independence.

2 years ago, I had an ischemic stroke that took sensation away from my right groin. I lost partial bladder control and pelvic floor tone. I kept doing kegels and other exercises, not knowing if I was doing them correctly because I couldn‚Äôt feel them.

Anyway, the doctor had told me during my morning visit that he was experiencing swelling in his brain & that I should ""be prepared to make some decisions I've never had to make before in my life"" ( exact words). So of course I left crestfallen around 10am (had been there since 6am but desperately needed to try to sleep. Also had to grocery shop for the dog & bird, as they have been living off scraps since Tuesday.). 


Anyway, after I got home & fed the animals I finally drifted off. When I woke up later in the afternoon, I called the nurses station to check on him & his nurse told me he made amazing progress. They had tried a new medication shortly after I went home this morning.  And the nurse Luke said that by lunchtime that he had noticed marked improvement in his condition. He is now FULLY AWAKE. He understands simple commands - he was asked to wiggle his foot/toes and he did, he was asked to give the thumbs up and he did, he was asked to hold his arm up and he did. He was asked to track objects and/or people and he did, although he seems to favor one side as far his eyes, he's able to look to the right & midline but 
looking/tracking to the left is not as easy for him. He can do it, but it takes him great effort. 

He is now breathing without the help of the ventilator - although he is still intubated because his throat has swelled around it & they have to wait for the swelling to go down for him to remove it.

12dwlee,stroke,1680812309.0,"As f today my affected index finger feels almost normal. (Just three fingers to go. My thumb always felt neurologically connected. 
A year and a half ago an occupational therapist suggested that I pick up coins to bring back the use of my hand. I wish I had the discipline to do it regularly at that time. I would be closer to recovery if I found my discipline earlier. A year of very little progress passed. That motivated me to do more therapy. 
Originally I was just supposed to pick up assorted US coins and drop them in a coffee mug but as I progressed, over time, I added to the exercise. Now I make each finger do a little dance about 50 times per finger per day. First I dump the coins onto a dish towel on my dining room table. The towel keeps the coins from rolling too fast. So more staples on the table. 
When I started doing the exercise I just used my affected thumb and index finger to pick up each coin one at a time Then I   I pinch(squeeze)each coin as hard as I cAn just before dropping it back into  in the  cup. Eventually the squeeze step made it possible for me to open a zippo bag. Then as that got easier, I iterated through each finger and thumb pair. After I progressed a little more,  I added a second round with the fifty coins. During the second round I picked up each  coin by its edges and tried to keep it horizontal until I dropped it back into my coffee cup.
  I progressed a little more added the finger dance. The dance has evolved over the last few months. Here is the current version. As a release the coin and drop it into the cup, I still have te finger neurologically isolated. So I start the dance then. I fully straighten and extend the finger. Then with the finger still straight I wag it fast two to four times. Then I  bend the finger and bring my hand close enough to the table to tap my finger on the table in a typing motion. I double tap the table quickly twice for a total of four taps. Then I tap four more times. This time I tap in a slow exaggerated motion and end by pressing down onthe table as hard as I can. I then lightly brush the table with the isolated finger tour times back and forth at two different speeds. Over the last six months This occupational therapy has progressively given me not only improved fine motor skills in my affected hand but it has also improved my sense of touch a lot. My ultimate goals for this exercise are to improve my typing ability and tie my shoes at least as well as I did in kindergarten. Both skills have improved after six months of a daily hour of this exercise. The first practical thing I noticed the exercise brought back was my ability to turn a doorknob and open a door with my affected hand. I also got a greater awareness of when I held something in my affected hand at about the same time. This made it easier to carry things around the house without dropping them. Then so noticed I could put Jasper‚Äôs harness on easier when he wanted to take me for a walk. Then zippers got easier. Shoe tying became a little easier. I‚Äôm still typing atone third my pre- stroke speed but I the Therapy allowed me to move each finger well enough to start typing exercises.  I may be the world‚Äôs slowest at tying shoes but I am get a little better at it each time I try thanks to the ‚Äúfinger dance ‚Äú occupational therapy. I typed about 55 WPM before my stroke. I typed14 WPM yesterday. I hope to exceed my pre stroke speed eventually. My goal is 60 WPM. 
I hope your recovery is going well. Try try finger dance or any part of it. Or  create your own dance if you want to improve your fine motor skills.

I had a carotid artery dissection diagnosed on 12.22.22 sent home on plavix only to have a stroke 3 days later as the dissection was too far along. Spent weeks in ICU then in patient rehab then participated in a study that focused on stroke survivors arm and hand rehab. Through all that I feel like I was pretty positive and morale was decent. About halfway through study they found another dissection in other carotid Therefore putting my so far unaffected and dominant right side at risk if I have another stroke. I was readmitted to the hospital but there‚Äôs nothing to be done except hope the anti platelet drugs do their job like the plavix didn‚Äôt.

Ok so I‚Äôve been living at my parents house with my husband and 2 little kids. After my 2nd hospital stay  morale dropped significantly. I feel like my physical health is so precarious and I‚Äôll live in fear of another dissection / stroke forever. 

I‚Äôm SO ANGRY. 
I‚Äôm angry at the dr who prescribed me plavix and sent me home. I‚Äôm angry at the drs who never really talked to me about how serious and permanent my vision loss is. I‚Äôm angry at my husband and my parents for not understanding / for offering the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù words of support and encouragement. I‚Äôm angry that I can‚Äôt be the mother I want to be for my children. I could go on and on and on. 

I know this is somewhat normal for emotions to be somewhat uncontrollable after brain injury but this is getting out of hand. I have started with a counselor but she‚Äôs cancelled several appts last minute. And it took forever to even find her. 

We live in a city 4 hours away from my parents house and are finally going home next week but I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm pushing the people that love me and are trying to help me away with my anger. Especially my husband who I know has been through a trauma with this as well. 

I know all the logical things I‚Äôm supposed to do here. Continue therapy continue taking /adjusting the lexapro for anxiety depression and try to move forward. But how do I leave the overwhelming grief and anger behind?

I called at a little after 5PM when I got out of work, and didn't get an answer. I left a message about I'd better not find him a frozen carcass on the floor...well, that's what I walked into. He was face down on the floor. He telling me that he thought he had a stroke and that I needed to call the EMT's. 

It took a few minutes and he had been down for like a half hour before I came home. He was taken to the local hospital, then taken to a bigger place in town. 

The diagnosis is a right side massive haemorraghic stroke. His BP had been through the roof when he got there and they got it down a little. He has no use of his left side. His right hand has tremors like Jello in an earthquake. He was responsive until he got to the city hospital. Then he went down hill and they had to intubate him and restrain his right arm so that he couldn't pull on any tubes and/or wires.

He's not really responsive today. He held my fingers with his right hand, but it's prolly just reflex. 

The neurosurgeon says that drilling into his skull or cutting a piece out of his skull won't do anything and I hafta think of ""Teh End."" 

He won't be able to walk, talk, feed himself, will be incontinent most like, will need a feeding tube and a breathing tube, and basically, to put it bluntly, weed and feed once a month like the rest of the rutabagas. My words not hers. She said root vegetable. \*shrug\*

I'm aware though that a lot of people are not as fortunate as I was in my recovery, and that realization really changed my perspective on everything.

My doctors were proud that I was making really great progress, and it really was great! But no one ever warned me about the emotional and mental distress that follows. I had never felt sadness, anger, self-hatred, and guilt that strong in my life. It didn't help either that I was under the care of my emotionally abusive mother.

The one thing I longed for was support from other people who had gone through the same thing. I know my friends tried to help, but they did not understand the severity of what I was going through. I was so distressed that I pushed them away and I was wrong for doing so. In the end, I found myself being a toxic source for people around me.

Everyday, I try to be better than I was before. Some days I think back to the stroke and I have small breakdowns because I remember the pain. There was so much emotional and physical pain. I find it hard to talk about sometimes because I can't seem to put into words how much it hurts. I remember having intense muscle pain on my left side for several weeks. So painful I could barely eat.

Learning to walk again was difficult but I was determined. I knew that the sooner I got better, then I can be free from my mom's horrible treatment of me. Eventually after 4 months of physical therapy, I was discharged. I held it in when my PT told me I would no longer need therapy, and when I got home I broke down in tears. It was the first time I've felt happiness in months. I slowly started exercising more and more since I knew it was up to me now to recover. I think that's when I also started to heal emotionally.

I wish I had known about this sub back then. It really would've helped me greatly. I am better now, away from my mother as well. When I met my boyfriend a few months ago, I kept the stroke a secret and when I told him, he did not think any differently of me. I've reached out to friends that I pushed away too and I apologized for how I treated them.

I know I am a different person than I was back then. I hated who I was before. I was selfish, arrogant, and lazy. An overall bitch. Sometimes I still feel that I still hold those traits now, but my friends assure me that I've grown into a better person. I find it hard to believe since I hold so much guilt in me, but I'm trying not to be too hard on myself.

It's been over 2 years since the stroke. I'm running a lot again, I got my license to drive, I'm studying an engineering course, and I've surrounded myself with good people. We don't really talk about the stroke, but I do bring it up when I see it necessary. My doctor says that I should be an advocate for healthy living because of what I went through. Hahaha! I do tell my friends to always watch their health. I went from alcoholic and rebellious teenager to mom of the group. And I'm proud of that. :)

I feel like I've rambled on for a while. I just got a little emotional today because I saw a picture of when I was in physical therapy. Just needed to vent.

We are at day 36. He‚Äôs been home for a week. I can thankfully say that this week he‚Äôs been progressing a lot faster. 

His BP is finally under control. Fever has settled. He is breathing mostly on his own. The doctor stopped by yesterday and deflated some of the trachea balloon. They‚Äôre going to start training him to get the tracheostomy out hopefully in a week. 

He‚Äôs been a lot more alert this week too. Holding eye contact a lot more. Following voices and people with his eyes. We got him a soft ball for yes and a hard ball for no and he‚Äôs been using them sometimes to answer questions. He‚Äôs responding very well to physiotherapy. Yesterday the occupational therapist came to see him for the first time and he was very responsive with him. They will start seeing him 3-4 times/ week. 

Throughout the week we‚Äôve been doing different things too. Got him some OT tools for his fine motor skills and he‚Äôs doing great with them. We gave him a pen and notebook and he had great grip on the pen and started scribbling on the notebook. Gave him a water bottle and he was screwing it and unscrewing it. He‚Äôs still scrolling on Instagram when I give him his phone. His nurses have been sitting him in a chair every day with increasing time. The past 2 days he‚Äôs been able to take a few steps with support. Today he was able to walk to a different room (also with support). 

Overall things are looking up. I still have days that my anxiety takes over and I break down but I don‚Äôt let him see me like that. My love for him is stronger than ever. Before all this happened I thought I had reached the max of being able to love someone. I was stupid. Almost losing him made me realize the capacity I have to love someone. Tbh that first week I was ready to just end it all. But here we are. He‚Äôs better. I‚Äôm ok. Every day I see more of him return and it gives me strength. 

It hasn‚Äôt been all peachy obviously. We‚Äôve had bumps in the road and had to be firm with some of his at home care about some things. But considering where we started I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1168go2/update_my_husband_m32_had_multiple_small_strokes/,Update: my husband (M32) had multiple small strokes during emergency open heart surgery.,,30,2,0.98
zjzb3p,stroke,1670852170.0,"Hello friends. I had a Ischemic Brainstem stroke 22 months ago and have made tremendous recovery. Brainstem stroke left my mind intact but destroyed my motor functions and balance. I can currently almost do everything I could do before stroke and I reached this level of recovery within 1 year of the stroke. 
There isn't much 'success stories' online from what I could see and I thought it might be helpful to share my experience which could help give people some hope.

There are still issues I currently still struggle with, for example my left leg still feels stiff and numb and have some issues with calve spasticity (likely could have been fixed already if I had seeked a botox injection rehab treatment which I put off). My left hand still feels about 50% numb. I used to have great balance but that was destroyed from the stroke. My left arm still feels abnormally weak but I attribute that to my lack of exercise this year. With these issues I can no longer pursue a professional athletic career but I can still pretty much do anything else.

When the doctor told me I had a stroke and nobody can tell me for sure how much recovery I can make, I knew I had to formulate a plan to make to most recovery. At the hospital I had all the time so I went on youtube and spent most my waking time learning about stroke and recovery. The expert opinion is brain plasticity is at an all time high 1-3 months immediately after the stroke so I learned I can potentially make giant recovery during these first few weeks. 

With my new knowledge I formed a plan which involved a very important mental gameplan: I needed to focus intensely on recovery and recovery only during this time (VERY IMPORTANT) and to clear my mind of all negative thoughts whenever it pops up. Now is not the time to be depressed, angry, sad or any state of mind that drains me of energy and motivation to maximise my crucially important recovery window. If I wanted to cry or be depressed I can do it after 1 year, after the best recovery time window is over. If I still feel like my recovery sucked I can complain about it. But now is not the time for complaining.

The first step of the grand recovery plan was I needed to regain my ability to walk. I did not want the nurses to come in to help me pee in a bottle so I tried my best to learn to (while holding onto railing) stand up and walk small steps. I had very bad dropfoot and could not control my toes and ankles. To fix the issue I spent a lot of time on youtube learning about rehab, stretches, exercises and massages to loosen tight muscles. I spent every moment of my day and nights in the hospital practice walking, learning online and thinking about how I'm going to recovery really well so I can go home and look after my son, my wife, mum and everyone who needs my help. There are still so many things I cannot wait to experience in the future, now was not the time to be stuck on a bed.

Within a week I left the hospital walking on my own two feet. 

I did physical therapy rehab for my leg and occupation therapy for my arm and hand for months after the stroke. Using their expertise and following their instructions as well as online sources and many hours of daily rehab on my own I was able to go back to normal life months after the stroke. My recovery slowed down after about a year but by then I'm already pretty much 'fully recovered' if that can be a thing. I went back to work 4 months after stroke and have been living a fulfilling life since. The biggest struggles came for me during the lockdowns where I could not go outside and they were a combination of mental struggles as well as completely derailing my physical recovery.

Those first 3 months after my stroke has actually become a highlight of my life that I look back upon fondly as the single minded focus towards recovery gave me clarity for my life that I never had before. Regaining my physical abilities gave me incredible sense of accomplishment and pride. There is much I still struggle with but I am optimistically prepared to deal with them in the future.

If anyone has any questions or want some advice feel free to ask. I would also like to hear if anyone else made 'full recoveries' like I did.

Last year I walked a half marathon, and spent some time trying to learn to run with pretty limited success (I definitely looked like a drunk person trying to run) but I‚Äôm happy I tried.

Just wanted to drop a quick post about vaccine/COVID-19 misinformation here on our sub. I know this may come as a surprise to many of you, but it seems we have a handful of people in our community that have *very* strong feelings regarding the pandemic and the subsequent vaccines. 

In the last few weeks when I‚Äôve removed a comment/post that could be outright harmful to one of our peers - said people will harass me (a fellow survivor, and just a moderator looking out for everyone‚Äôs best interests) in my private messages. They‚Äôve gone on to create multiple burner accounts to continue harassing and posting bul**hit here in r/stroke. I‚Äôve done my best to keep it out of the public eye entirely.

Many subreddits on Reddit have gone in to private mode solely because of situations like this, combined with Reddit‚Äôs inability to take a firm stance. That is the *last* thing we want as a mod team. It genuinely hurts me knowing that a portion of our community that I became a part of following my stroke, and was then fortunate enough to help it grow and thrive as a moderator - is capable of this. I can‚Äôt make a comment/post of my own, or remove a post/comment on r/stroke without potentially compromising things in my real life. Someone tried to find out my personal information *over a horse dewormer post*.

This isn‚Äôt meant to be a sob story or anything remotely close to that, I just don‚Äôt know what to do or say anymore besides making this post. Especially knowing certain people are reading this and salivating over my sadness. 

LONG STORY SHORT:

Vaccine misinformation of *any* kind, or the private harassment of *any* member or moderator is not going to be tolerated in any way whatsoever. Contact me directly if someone violates this basic rule #3 of Reddit. Enough people have died.

o6mvm9,stroke,1624485072.0,"Last month, my boyfriends mother (he's 21) had an artery dissection (two of her arteries in her brain completely ripped) and caused her to have a stroke. She was bleeding in her brain and was in a coma with a machine breathing for her. Things were not looking good as she had to have a very risky procedure to put a stent in her brain. The doctors said that there was a chance that she would have a massive stroke that she would never survive. 2 nights after, she suffered from the strokes that the doctors were so scared about. They couldn't tell if she had 2 or 10. They told my boyfriend and his family that there was a 5-10% chance she would ever speak or walk again. They said she would most likely never breathe or eat on her own again. In the doctors' words, ""keeping her alive would be like keeping a vegetable alive"", and were giving them options to take her off of life support. The very next day, she became responsive again. A day after that, they were able to take the ventilator out and she was able to speak (very limited). Everyday since then, she has only gotten better. She is able to move both her right and left side. She is speaking just like she used to (not even slurring!). She is beginning to walk and has been eating on her own. Of course she is not in the same health as she was before, but she has proved every doctor wrong. They told us rehab would be a long journey (6 months- 1 year). She has been in rehab for a little over a week and they are already making plans to release her!

When things were looking bad, I looked in this subreddit a lot for even a glimmer of hope. I wanted to write this in hopes that someone who is in the same boat will see it. These are the biggest lessons we have learned from this:

1.) Never underestimate the power of prayer.

2.) It's not over until it's over. Keep hope for your loved one.

3.) Hug your loved ones tight and let go of your problems. One day they can be fine and the next they can be in the ICU with machines breathing for them.

1f19a6o,stroke,1724626404.0,"I had a very rare stroke caused by an AVM rupture at 19 years old on the day of my friend‚Äôs funeral. May 19, 2014. I did not have the classic symptoms of stroke, although in hindsight I had a migraine that lasted an entire month prior to the stroke that my PCP didn‚Äôt take me seriously and didn‚Äôt order imaging/CT scan/angiogram done. This could have been prevented, that alone fills me with rage. All I remember was feeling suddenly dizzy, going completely blind and falling to the ground within seconds because my left side went paralyzed. Long story short, I had an emergency craniotomy. My family was given 5 minutes to decide whether to not do surgery, do chemotherapy, or go through with a very risky surgery. They chose for me to do the surgery. I actually died and I have vivid memories of floating and seeing the surgery happening. Survived the surgery and woke up 3 days later. 

Now, the aftermath‚Ä¶ I was told by my neurosurgeon that I‚Äôll never be able to walk or speak again. Well, my first words I said after I woke up was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry‚Äù (lol). I remember being so devastated one moment then grateful for the stroke happening. I called it divine intervention because it helped me escape from my rapist/abuser. During the moments I was devastated, I‚Äôd cry nonstop and I had to do round the clock physical therapy all while crying. I was a mess. When I finally got tingles in my left leg they had me relearn how to walk again. I was only able to stay in the hospital for a month because at the time that‚Äôs all my insurance would cover. Had I stayed longer I probably/could‚Äôve potentially recovered more. That alone too fills me with rage.

Coming home after discharge felt so‚Ä¶ weird. On one hand I was struggling to grasp, come to terms with becoming disabled, and grieving over the life I could‚Äôve had if I didn‚Äôt have the stroke happen. I spent the rest of 2014 and the entirety of 2015 sleeping all day everyday and laying in my bed. I was in a very, very, severe state of depression. Mind you I was already struggling with depression before my stroke. I went to outpatient occupational therapy where I made progress but not enough to recover fully.

Where am I now? I‚Äôm 29, still trying to get my degree after being in college since July 2014. I know. That‚Äôs a long time to be in college. I should have my degree already.
The lasting damage has me disabled. I never recovered fully, but it‚Äôs also my fault because I didn‚Äôt do therapy at home like I should have. I have spasticity on my entire left side, I have an unpredictable foot drag where some days I‚Äôm able to walk almost normally but then there‚Äôs days where I find myself limping and falling over. I don‚Äôt really use my left hand because my thumb and pointer finger are stuck in a curled up position that never went away. When I‚Äôm out in public I try my best to ‚Äúlook normal‚Äù, and this might sound ableist but I wanted/want to hide my disability. It‚Äôs a conscious effort everyday trying to open my hand, not do the thing where my arm raises up, and not fall because my foot isn‚Äôt cooperating. This is the damage the stroke left me with. It‚Äôs still painful to be disabled, both physically and emotionally. I say that because I lost my ability to write, to draw, to have a normal functioning hand, being severely limited in what I can or can‚Äôt do. It makes me bitter. To add salt and alcohol to the wound, my mother has this delusional idea that one day I‚Äôll be able to recover fully because god told her and she had a dream about it or some shit. It doesn‚Äôt help that my sister tells me to do more physical therapy exercises but I don‚Äôt see the point as I‚Äôve gone to physical therapy on and off again but haven‚Äôt made a dent in my progress. Well, I‚Äôve been stuck with everlasting damage that affects everything in my life. I should probably be more grateful that I‚Äôm able to walk/talk because it could be ‚Äúa lot worse‚Äù but I‚Äôm not. This shit hurts. I was so young and just starting my life.

I‚Äôm bitter because the stroke flipped my whole world upside down. One day I‚Äôm a normal functioning being the next I‚Äôm disabled with no clue if I‚Äôd ever walk again. I can‚Äôt run at all, I can‚Äôt go hiking, and I had to give up my career that was barely starting as a cosmetologist. it ruined the little confidence I had in myself, hell, it ruined dating/making friends for me too as nobody wants a disabled person. The stroke robbed me of my independence. There‚Äôs not a day where I wake up and wish so bad that I could be normal one day. 

I know I should get a therapist to work through these emotions but due to insurance and the fact that it takes time/money to find a good therapist that‚Äôs also within my network and I just can‚Äôt afford that. So I‚Äôm unloading my story here. I never got a chance to talk about it and even then I don‚Äôt talk about it because nothing that anybody could say will make a difference because they haven‚Äôt gone through this. 

I am bitter and full of quiet rage.

I was surprised when I woke up every day. The headaches were terrible and no one was willing to give me anything effective for pain. One thing they were right about was saying the headaches would go away when the blood in my brain was reabsorbed. And just like magic one day the headache was gone. Subsequent scans confirmed it. Pain meds were available and I will never forgive them for refusing to give me what I needed. But I lived through it and I am sure I probably took too much Tylenol.

The ICU was a trauma on its own. 2 days without food or water(I did have an IV). 2 days forced to stay in bed. They would not let me use the restroom or attend to my personal needs. Even though I was capable of doing those things myself. I was always waiting for technicians to say I was ok. Had to wait for 1 person to say I could eat and drink and wait for another to say I could walk. Probably would have tolerated it better if I had been unconscious. I wasn‚Äôt sick enough to be there.

So far I have attended all my Neuro appointments. I haven‚Äôt actually seen a neurologist since my first appointment. I have been relegated to nurses and there is no treatment or anything diagnostic happening. They just ask how I am doing and do I have any symptoms. And then schedule another appointment. I have no idea why I should still be going there.  I plan to get some answers at my next appointment. 

But in the end, I was lucky. I have no real deficits. My life is normal. I can still function physically and mentally. The only things I still notice are my crunchy neck and I have more leg cramps than I did before. For a while my jaw was also crunchy but that has improved so I hope the neck will too.

ndekoy,stroke,1621132479.0,"My dad had a stroke the day after I turned 15 and it turned my life upside down. He was my best friend and cheerleader and everything changed overnight. 

It was a huge stroke, my family was very lucky that he survived. He spent a week in the icu, another three weeks in the hospital, then another two months in rehab. He had hemiplegia on the right side, only regaining movement in his hip and a little in his knee. I couldn‚Äôt talk to him the way we used to because his language was very limited. He became very easily frustrated and a bit impulsive. He struggled with his PT, OT, and speech therapies and the slow progress led him to be extremely depressed. I tried so many times to introduce him to things that he could do, but after a few years he mostly gave up.

Over time his health deteriorated. He had frequent migraines which he was going to the doctor for, but the doctor just chalked it all up to his history of stroke and never looked into it. Turns out the men on my father‚Äôs side of the family have inherited a rare congenital illness that affects the carotid artery that was causing the headaches (and ultimately, his stroke). This was found a little too late and he was put on hospice. We expected to have a few months, but it turned out we only had a few weeks. I wasn‚Äôt present as I could have been because I thought I had time.

I wish I took more time to listen and advocate for him. I am so angry because many of the doctors involved just saw a disabled man, and assumed that he didn‚Äôt need a high level of investigation because he had a ‚Äúlow quality of life‚Äù so it wasn‚Äôt worth their time. He was worth so much. Even when he could barely walk he would move around his yard in his wheelchair to plant flowers with one arm because he just wanted to make his neighborhood a little more beautiful. He loved people so intensely and so openly. He wasn‚Äôt perfect, but he was just a very good person.

I know things could have still turned out less than perfect if the circumstances were different, but I can‚Äôt help but think if a little more time and effort went into his care, he may have had a bit longer.

m7vziz,stroke,1616088388.0,"This week I decided to write an article about sex after stroke. I did not write it to get more clicks. I genuinely see this topic as something that does not get addressed enough during rehabilitation because either you or the therapist feels awkward having that conversation. But it is so necessary to help rebuild confidence.

I put a lot of thought into this article to keep it professional and make the information simple. Here's an excerpt from [Sex After Stroke](https://elysenewland.com/articles/sex-after-stroke) to give you an idea of what to expect:

""Talking about sex can sometimes be a taboo topic, so I wanted to clarify why I decided to write about it. Sex is something that often gets overlooked in the rehab process and by the time you get home, you likely won't reach out to a healthcare professional to ask questions. It can be embarrassing to ask about sex and intimacy.

Having sex after a stroke can be really **intimidating and scary**. A lot of survivors wonder, will this cause another stroke? Will I be able to function normally? Will I still feel attractive? How will I do it?

My goal is to answer these questions and give you some ideas to navigate these waters without feeling embarrassed. You may even want to read through this article with your partner. It can help them understand what you're dealing with and open the lines of communication between you, which you'll find is one of the most important pieces.""

This had a big impact on the self-help groups and my inability to connect to anybody there, the level of rehabilitation that's offered as I find it severely lacking and the ""climate"" in any rehab facility. 

In the self-help group that is near me nearly everyone simply retired after their stroke and no one could connect to the time pressure that I experience, trying to get fit enough to work asap.

Another example - when I got out of immediate rehab after 3 months all Physio, Ergo and Logotherapy were reluctant to offer me an appointment on the same day as my other appointments, quoting severe exhaustion in their patients as reason. It took me weeks of convincing or straight up lieing to get those appointments.

qkiwld,stroke,1635787379.0,"So, a few weeks ago I posted about how my dad had a hemorrhagic stroke on the early morning of September 24. He spent 9 days in ICU (had surgery for his brain bleed on the fourth day), another week or so in a step-down at the hospital and for the last 3 1/2 weeks at an inpatient rehab program.

He's able to speak no problem, feed himself, move his right side, and has pretty much all of his memory (some short-term things here and there like introducing us to nurses, etc. but not too bad) but was completely paralyzed on his left side.

That thankfully changed on Saturday when my fiancee and I were working on some exercises with him and he was able to kick up his left foot 4-5 inches on command. In total on Saturday, he kicked it up about 40 or so times (we did 4 sets of 10). They've been hoisting him into a wheelchair the past few days and getting him out into the activities room, which looks to have improved his blood circulation and overall movement as well. I imagine laying in a bed 24/7 makes it very difficult especially when all the blood leaves the leg.

Although small, it was such an amazing thing to see and we made sure to show a LOT of encouragement to him about this milestone. He did the same thing on Sunday, and this time my mom was able to see his foot movement as well. When he was placed back in bed Sunday afternoon, he was able to shake his leg on command and we told him he needs to keep working on this every day even when he's not in therapy. 

I'm not sure exactly where to go from here, but I will for sure be pushing him this week to keep working on his left leg, foot and arm (still no movement, but he's working on it). I also want to make sure the therapist knows of this development and that they continue working on him getting more movement.

I know my dad will eventually have to go back in for surgery to place the skull bone back in and that will take some time for the sedatives to wear off and for him to recover from that, but I just wanted to share and see if anyone had anything to add.

2827dt,stroke,1402675809.0,"Hi, I recently turned 29, but had a Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) last year. Apologies, but this is going to be a lengthy one...

I know they're known as 'mini strokes', but that seems to lessen the severity of the episode, in some way.

Anyway...

I got married on 29th of June, 2013, and we moved house a few weeks later. (A week or so before the move, I had the worst migraine of my life... It wouldn't shift, and my sense of taste had gone very strange... Everything tasted too sweet... Sickeningly so...) On the final day of our move, after repositioning all the furniture, me and my wife decided to head out and pick something up for dinner from the local supermarket. Part way round the shop, she started acting somewhat odd towards me, telling me to ""stop being stupid"" and ""stop taking the piss"".

I genuinely had no idea what she was on about at first, but I started feeling limp on my left side, and then I took another step and realised my left leg just had no strength. I hit the floor pretty hard.

Looking back and talking to my wife about that moment, she said that she thought I was doing a Walter White Jr/RJ Mitte (From Breaking Bad) impression to embarrass her.

Anyway, after I collapsed (I actually fell into some woman, but she was fantastic and called the ambulance and things for us), I sat on the floor with my wife propping me up, and the entire left side of my body and face was limp.

As soon as this happened, the first thing that came to mind is the UK's NHS [Act F.A.S.T. campaign](http://www.nhs.uk/actfast/Pages/stroke.aspx) and I knew exactly what was going on... It was odd, me having this realisation, quietly, while unable to speak, but while all those around me were panicking... It was somewhat surreal.

Anyway, it took about 15 minutes for the ambulance to arrive, by which point, I had regained a lot of my motor controls, but my face and head were still numb on the left side.

We got to the hospital, very busy for a Sunday evening, and I was placed on a bed in a corridor for a couple of hours... During this time, it happened again, I could feel my left side going dead and I couldn't sign my own name on the admittance forms.

The doctor who I tried to get the attention of didn't actually seem to care...

Anyway, they eventually put me in a ward over night, (it was about 11pm at this point) the ward was horrible, it was a mens' ward, but full of lots of elderly, very unwell men. Some of which were clearly not in full control of their faculties, it was so sad and I feel really mean for getting frustrated with them, but one chap kept getting out of bed in the middle of the night and sitting on the edge of my bed.
I know he wasn't too blame, but I was feeling like shit and really struggled with it... 

I generally just tried to help the nurses get him back in bed, though.

Anyway, three days of blood tests and things, somebody decides to do an LP (Lumbar Puncture) to check my spinal fluid. Now, after an LP, the patient is supposed to remain horizontal for a couple of days as the imbalances caused by the procedure inflict severe headaches and the likes if you sit up. But, ignoring this, the following day, I was sent across the city to another hospital for an X-ray... Sat up in a waiting room there for three hours... Only to be told I hadn't actually been booked in for the X-ray, and was sent back to my ward, back across the city... It wasn't the most pleasant of experiences...

On the fifth day, they decided to send me for an MRI.
All the MRI technicians and the likes were very blunt and a little unprofessional with me, as though they felt I shouldn't really be here, or whatever, but continued with the MRI... Now, things got a little... ... odd...

While I was in the MRI, suddenly, I heard a little commotion outside...

Then, after the MRI, everyone was suddenly being really nice to me, almost too nice...

I get back to my ward and my wife is waiting for me, teary-eyed.

Apparently, they had found a number of old lesions that had mostly healed, but there were what was described as a ""scattershot"" of fresh lesions.

The doctor stated that, all these years I had been suffering from migraines, a number of them were actually likely to be small TIA's... It's just this one was a lot bigger and a lot more serious than the others... But, anyway, the FINALLY started me on blood thinners and the likes, after five days... Yeah, ""Act F.A.S.T"" my arse...

Lost and lots of tests later, it turns out I have a hole in my heart that is likely to blame, but rather than surgery, just a prescription of blood thinners for the rest of my life is the recommended treatment.

I started university shortly after the big TIA, and honestly, really struggled... The TIA seems to have permanently affected my short term memory and ability to follow lists and instructions, but, I still managed to get straight into second year of uni and have just finished, passed everything totally fine... Finally feel like I'm on the mend. And have just been out for the first cycle in the 11 months since the attack...

Finally feel like I might be getting life back on track... Albeit with a few strange sensations and the likes...

Some things still don't quite taste right and I have a number of patches on the left side of my head and arm were temperature doesn't quite feel right OR I still have no feeling, but, considering the situation many find themselves in after a blood clot in the brain, I consider myself to be *very* lucky...


Anyway, very sorry about the hella' long post...

104jjek,stroke,1672976038.0,"Hi there! It has been just over one year since my father suffered a massive hemorrhagic stroke in his basal ganglia. Now that he is officially this far along in his post-stroke recovery journey, I thought it would be a good time to pause and reflect on my journey as my father‚Äôs advocate. I hope that is okay to do in this space! 

Advocacy is the biggest, most important lesson that I have learned in the past year as my father‚Äôs medical decision-maker, oldest child, and (for several months out of this past year) primary caregiver.  I would like to describe a few of the experiences that my family and I have endured in this regard below, not to complain or focus on the negative aspects of his experiences, but to remind all of you survivors and caregivers that you are not crazy or irrational if you have experienced something similar. If your gut is telling you that something is wrong, you have the right to speak up, ask questions, and make your concerns known.

¬∑  Upon arriving in the emergency room, my father was incorrectly identified (including on his hospital bracelet) by my grandfather‚Äôs name and information. Yes! Even though my father was accompanied by his driver‚Äôs license to the hospital and even though it remained at his bedside in the emergency room, he was still mistaken for my grandfather. My grandfather, by the way, had been dead for many years at that point in time. If I did not notice and speak up, would they have treated my father according to the information in my grandfather‚Äôs medical history? 

¬∑  After concluding his stay in the traditional hospital, my father spent approximately 2 months in a long-term acute care hospital. Here, any time his primary doctor felt he was ‚Äúagitated‚Äù, she would administer him a shot of Ativan. It was not until I questioned this doctor‚Äôs assessment of my father‚Äôs mood and behavior that I learned that, according to her own self-report, she and the other healthcare personnel administer Ativan ‚Äúfor the sake of quietness on the hospital floor‚Äù. WHAT?! Not to mention that any reasonable person, much less any person who has spent months in the hospital at this point, would be alarmed by the fact that they are being sedated because their doctor feels they are not ‚Äúquiet‚Äù enough. If I did not fire this doctor from his case, how would his recovery have looked different?

¬∑  My dad now stays in a skilled nursing facility. On his first day there, one of the nurses ignored my pleas to let me demonstrate how to help my dad transfer from his wheelchair to his bed (his inpatient and outpatient acute rehab therapists spent months on end specifically training me to do so). Instead, over the sound of my clearly concerned voice, she figured she would give it the ‚Äòole college try. After he nearly fell to the floor, she finally turned to me for help. If the bed had not been there for my dad to desperately grab hold of, what may have happened? 

If these experiences sound familiar to you, whether you are a survivor, caregiver, or another loved one of someone who has suffered a stroke, you are not alone. Medical professionals must **earn** your trust, just as anyone else in your life does (if not more). If you are concerned, confused, uncertain, etc., you are allowed to speak up. You deserve answers, explanation, and conversation. Your lives are more than worthy of a doctor‚Äôs time, energy, and breath. How would my dad‚Äôs situation be different if I did not learn to be a fierce advocate? If I did not require others to earn my trust? 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I am not sure that anyone needed to hear these stories, but I know I would have appreciated hearing them at the time. I am happy that I was able to share this pieces of our story; I hope that this has helped someone in some way, shape, or form (feel free to message me if you would like to know more or even just for a listening ear).

zdlvh4,stroke,1670278671.0,"Well... Here goes a long story

My Mom is an incredible woman who has endured so much. Especially this last year. She's a fighter. 

She's the matriarch of our family. She has 5 kids. I'm her youngest (33F) and she cares for me. I am physically disabled and have lived under her care my entire life. I cannot adequately describe how close of a relationship we have. She has fought to keep me alive for many years. She's my biggest advocate, my best friend, and the best mother. 

She grew up fast in a very traumatic way. All of her family are gone except her baby sister (now 50). She herself is a recovered alcoholic (sober for 10 years). She didn't drink all the time, but once a year she would leave and be gone for 2 or 3 days. I always knew she would come back. She promised me that she would never leave me. She always came back. She drank to escape. Her and my Dad always had a rocky relationship. Just this summer, they separated for the final time, after nearly 40 years. She took it very hard. She hates him but still loves him. He's just done. He's my Dad, and I love him, but he is an asshole.

Mom is a workaholic. She has 3 jobs, plus cares for me. She's a boss. An HBIC if you will. She's smart and extremely caring but she can hurt you very easily. She always had a temper. She can be very intimidating. She can be venomous. She hates receiving help. She is a control freak. She gets shit done. She makes things happen. 

Well, the day before my birthday on October 21st, she suffered a hemorrhagic stroke. She never presented typical symptoms of stroke. It seemed like she was about 6 beers in. We spent the weekend trying to figure out if she was taking something for pain (she had a cosmetic laser peel done that day) but when we got home on Sunday the 23rd, we called EMS. They took her to the hospital and she had a seizure. She had one on Saturday night too. They sent her to the next city for a CT scan and found a significant bleed on her right frontal lobe. They sent her to another nearby bigger city and they did an MRI (attached). 

The white is swelling and the dark is blood. There was too much of it to see what happened. 

Meanwhile my world was flipped. My oldest brother (44) came home on the 29th and brought me down to his place in the same city so I could be close to Mom as she recovers. He's also taking care of me. 

Mom has made incredible progress. She doesn't remember much of the first two weeks, but she remembers segments of the weekend of her stroke. 

Her executive reasoning and behaviour were impacted. Since then she has regained her cognitive function. She is essentially back. She's a bit more short of patience. She knows enough to be nice to people. She's seeing a psychologist for counselling and it is helping her process and control her emotions. 

She's in inpatient rehabilitation. It's been a month. She may be discharged to outpatient rehab in the next few days. Physically she's fine, she even lost some weight. She's very strong as she can transfer me by herself (I am small, about 95lbs) from ideal heights such as from my wheelchair to my raised hospital bed. We are well versed in making sure there's no bending. We will be getting a patient transfer lift soon, we were working on that pre-stroke. 

Her team want to wait until 6 months post-stroke to do another MRI to hopefully see what happened. The general assumption for now is that she had a very slow bleed for at least one month prior to the stroke. 

Naturally we are terrified this will happen again. We may not be so lucky. What is your thoughts on this, given her incredible progress? Last we heard 3 weeks ago, the swelling had shrunk by 40%.

She still has a shorter attention span but it's getting better. She can hold her focus much longer. They have suspended her drivers license and she wants to work on getting it back when we go home (we live rural). 

Now Mom's team say she may not be able to care for me anymore. But they don't know us. They don't see us work together. I don't know if they are worried about this happening again or if they are worried about her attention. I can help her. I always do. I always have. 

They don't know how close we are or our co-dependence. Mom doesn't want me to leave, I don't want to leave. We need each other. 

Right now we want to go home and settle back into our safe little bubble while she recovers. We plan to move here to the city soon after. Mom has it in her head that she's gonna go back to work soon. She has sick/holiday pay until the end of January and then over a year of disability with 70% wage. She doesn't need to rush back. 

I guess I'm just looking for some kind of reassurance.",https://i.redd.it/knnct8d1474a1.jpg,Mom (61) had a hemorrhagic stroke 10/21/2022. Need some mental health support please,,28,7,0.97

If anything can be done to prevent it happening again, no one knows what. Maybe stronger/better blood thinners?

after chatting with u/AIHURR a few weeks ago, i come to you all today to share my story and a project i have been developing to help other young (and not so young) folks who share a similar experience. 

i am a 24 yo stroke survivor (ischemic stroke, july 2018), and although i am fortunate that I didn't suffer long term physical impairment, this experience has tremendously changed the person i am today, and how i view the world and myself. 

As a designer and masters student, I am currently working on a holistic therapeutic video game and server based virtual reality social platform for stroke recovery. So far, i have been developing the game based on my own experience, and what i personally went through.
Now, i am looking to develop the game further with the help of others, and their input! 

I am looking into developing this further after i graduate, and in a clinical context to properly assert the psychological benefits of such a game !

I would like to create a team of around 5-7 individuals (at this stage! Later on, hopefully, everyone will be able to take part in the project and play the game and participate in the social platform) who :

-have either had a stroke recently or in recent years ( with and without long term physical impairments ! Everyone is welcome.)
-are willing to assist me in reviewing the different features within the journey,
-are willing to offer some time to discuss the project as a whole, and as a group!


I was also thinking on posting in the community some polls regarding the game, and the different features so that more people can participate in the development process! 


Any thoughts so far on this? Any insight is valuable! 


warm wishes and thanks to all, stay safe!

d2vw3h,stroke,1568231515.0,"Each year, I do something special with my loved ones. Tonight, my girlfriend is taking me to dinner to celebrate overcoming my two strokes. I also post a little blurb on social media to acknowledge the date. 


Here's what I shared with my friends today:


> 7 years have passed since my first of two strokes caused by a torn artery in my brain. The second took place the next day from the same injury. It‚Äôs a very long, epic, and heartwarming story which many of you lived through with me. But the gist is I tore my right vertebral artery, it bled, clotted, and caused two medium/small strokes that left me with a permanent blindspot and thankfully nothing worse. 


> Each year that passes provides me with more gratitude for the life I'm fortunate enough to keep living. This past year has been without a doubt the most rewarding. I met and fell in love with my best friend, *girlfriend*, and together we've been chosen by our perfect kitty, Major Garland Briggs. I've never felt love so strong as the love our little family shares, and not a day goes by that I don't say it out loud to *girlfriend* and Major. 


> 7 years post-stroke feels like an eternity sometimes. Other times, it feels like yesterday that I was discharged from the hospital. Each day is a gift. I love that I can still open them up to see what's inside. Today is a good day.


> Love this life.


I hope today finds you all well, and I wish you or your loved ones continued success in your recoveries.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/d2vw3h/its_my_7year_strokeiversary_today/,It's my 7-year Stroke-iversary today.,,26,8,0.97
1fe48si,stroke,1726038990.0,"5 days ago, my wife was found unconscious at work and 911 was called. She was transferred to an ER where they said they couldn‚Äôt do much for her. They put her on Propofol and Fentanyl. She has a history of hypertension. 

Soon after, they notified us that she would be transferred to another ER with an available neurosurgeon. She was then transferred via ambulance and the neurosurgeon conducted a CT scan and found the hemorrhage. She was sent to the OR and an External Ventricular Drain (EVD) was placed in her brain. Additionally, she developed pneumonia. 

Fast forward to today, she is in the ICU and on Propofol, Fentanyl and Nicardipine on and off to help control blood pressure. Neuro exams have been somewhat positive. She is responding to pain in her extremities and pupil movement. They took her off Propofol for about an hour to wake her up. Her eyes were open and looked confused state. She responded to my voice and tried to look at me but her blood pressure would rise and the neurosurgeon recommended she be placed back on Propofol to help lower her BP. 

These past few days have been really hard. We‚Äôve been married for over 20 years and seeing a loved one in this state is absolutely agonizing. I‚Äôve spent every single day at her bedside during authorized visiting hours (9am-9pm).

1f2pcbe,stroke,1724785600.0,"At 20, I had a hemorrhagic stroke out of nowhere. My health was completely fine when it happened, and it was for the most mundane reason ever ‚Äì picking up my sister from school. I went into a coma for a week and had to start my life over since then. Some people talk about having wild dreams while in a coma, but for me, it was just a blink of an eye. I really wish I could have had something wild to dream about to share when I go back to my normal life, but I guess I didn't know my life would change forever.

As a result of the stroke, I ended up with hemiplegia as the biggest sequel, but I did recover quickly in the first year ‚Äì at least that's what the doctors and my therapists said. By the third month, I was able to walk (albeit poorly and without feeling the ground), but I got used to it. Now I'm even able to thread a needle, get dressed, and walk feeling just a little bit. What they say about walking on the beach is true.

I had to take time off from college to undergo physical therapy and learn to use my body again. I didn't know that friends would just disappear, turning to dust, or see them continue with their lives while I struggled to get back to basic things like walking, holding, or feeling. But I guess I was too naive. Although the phrase ""you know who your real friends are in hard times"" is true, even though I never thought I'd experience it firsthand.

I just moved into a new house and will probably change colleges because it's still difficult to visit places I used to go before and compare myself. But I reconnected with my family, had a lot of great times with extended family, and even though there's a part of me that wishes this never happened, I'm happy with how things turned out.

Honestly, when all of this started, I was on the verge of tears all the time. The amount of antidepressants I had to take to keep myself in check was awful. I slept most of the time or was a threat to myself by lashing out on myself because I was unable to do things I thought it was basic. I was too scared, my life was falling apart, but I didn't know it was falling apart because I was creating a new one. This is just a quick vent? a hope for a breakthrough? I don't know, but I had to take it out.

-Hygiene, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to shower alone and nurses were busy, so my lovely and thoughtful friends made me a care package containing large hygiene wipes and deodorant. It was a game changer in helping me to feel that I‚Äôm in charge even a little bit!

-Small and silent electric toothbrush with a soft brush head 

-Haircare: especially for women, the coarse hospital sheets are really damaging for hair rubbing against the pillowcases constantly, so they brought me a silk scarf to lessen the damage and matting and with the permission from the nurses they washed and deep conditioned my hair from time to time. It restored some of the self confidence that I had lost. 

-Noice cancelling headphones to drown out noisy machines and snoring roommates 

-Long 3 meter phone charger so I don‚Äôt need to be in awkward positions trying to plug it in. 

-I couldn‚Äôt really read afterwards, so they brought me comics instead. There‚Äôs actually a couple really good ones centering around brain trauma and infarcts.

d4aj77,stroke,1568492798.0,"TL;DR: Had a stroke 4 years ago. Life is different but mostly good.   
Today is 4 years after my ischemic stroke.  I was lucky that after the first few days, I had no major mobility problems.  My speech and memory were another matter.   I still remember the first day the speech therapist visited me in the hospital.  She showed a list of ten words.  They were familiar, I could pronounce them, but I had no ideas what they were.  Talking was baffling.  I couldn't find the correct words when I talked or wrote.  I said he when I meant she.  I said floor when I meant flour.  I was terrified that I would not be able to do my job (I work in IT).  The very first thing I did when I got out of the hospital was to login into my computer at home.  I remembered the username and the password, and I was able to type in commands.  What a relief! I did 12 weeks of speech therapy and eventually got good enough to speak that I was able to go back to work. I still have glitches.  Last week, I was talking to someone about a song performed by Kelly Clarkson, but I all I could say was Carrie Underwood. Occasionally I just lose a word or a definition.  These are the WTF moments,  I think I'll always have them.      
Four years later,  I've learned to cope.  I hesitate a bit when answering questions, so I can select the correct words.  The faster I try to verbally respond, the more chance that I will stumble. My speech deteriorates when I get tired. Sometimes I forget a word and I have to stumble around to find a different way to get the idea across. I have a hole in my short term memory. I can finish a conversation and 30 seconds later not remember it.  I take notes and repeat back the notes to my co-worker. I use a lot of sticky notes to remember things.   Learning is harder.  It takes me more repetitions to learn and remember concepts and procedures.    I know that research has said that there is no real multi-tasking in the brain, just task switching.   My task switching is much slower. I try to avoid conversations while driving.  I can't keep track of two simultaneous conversations anymore, and I have to read in a quiet place.                                                                    
Adjusting to the new reality is sometimes frustrating. I feel like my wife thinks I've lost half of my brain.  Overall, I'm not complaining.  I know how fortunate I am and how much worse it could have been. I can walk.  I can talk.  I can comprehend.  These are gifts.  My stroke was home, on my front porch. An hour earlier I would have been driving my grandson on the freeway.  That still gives me chills.    
When I was on medical leave, I watched [a TEDTalk by Jill Bolte Taylor](https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight?language=en).  She describes her stroke and the aftermath.  I didn't have the moment of insight, but I was inspired by the recovery she made and her ability to share her message coherently. If she could come back, then so could I.  Mostly, I have.   
My insight from my stroke is twofold:  We need to make the most of our days on this earth, and we need to support those who are struggling.   I'm thankful for the things I've learned from this subreddit, and I hope I can be supportive of those who come here needing help.

I remember texting with my friend in the other room and telling him I was feeling out of it. Then I started feeling numb. I suddenly couldn't figure out how to use my phone. I knew something was wrong and I needed help but I wasn't able to get out of bed to the next room. I was really unbalanced. So I tried to yell to my friend ""hey something is wrong, I feel really weird. I need help."" But all that I could get out of my mouth was the word ""helping."" So I just started screaming ""HELPING HELPING I NEED HELPING"" and none of my friends could understand what was going on. I was trying to say ""I need to go to the hospital."" Again, all that I could say was ""hospital"" and ""911."" Getting these words out took so much concentration. They called 911 and the cops and paramedics came and immediately accused me of being on drugs... They just hung around for so long questioning me and my friends like criminals and after about 20 minutes took me to the hospital. They strapped me into gurney and continued to berate me in the ambulance asking me where the drugs were. I could barely speak at all. I just wanted my mom so badly. I took every ounce of strength I had to remember phone number. I just started shouting her number over and over and over and over again and saying ""phone! mom!"" They refused to call her.  At least an hour had passed from when the symptoms came on to when they finally go me into the hospital. Again, they were all convinced I was just on drugs so basically all they did was take my blood pressure and temperature. No scans, no blood tests. Nothing. They sent me out of the hospital with no pants or shoes (I was about to go to bed so I was just wearing a tee shirt and underwear). Anyway, fast forward - about a year goes by and I finally have health insurance and I see multiple doctors that believe I had a stroke and have referred me for an MRI.

But the worst thing, for me, is that he is a different person now.  He used to be steady, thoughtful, rational, methodical, kind, and calm.  Now he is like that sometimes.  The rest of the time--well, yesterday, he screamed horrible things at his tween child for using one sink to clean something instead of another sink, when it didn't matter a damn.  He wants to have piles and piles of things that he likes to eat, and if I will only buy what we can store, then he wails and stomps his feet.  He has decided that he doesn't want there to be a leak in the roof so he will scream and howl and roar at you until you agree with him that the water on the floor is cat pee.  And so on, and so on.

Just this summer, he has shown glimpses of self awareness.  Before he would apologize only if we looked upset, or he would attack us verbally or with mocking nonsense noises if we looked upset, so we learned how not to look upset.  And he would apologize only to shut us up or if he thought we were going to leave him.  Now he is genuinely remorseful.  But because brain injury, he up and does it again.

He is also helpful sometimes, thoughtful sometimes, steady and methodical sometimes, and so forth.  He is my husband except that he can't talk or use one hand.  And then in an instant he turns from my husband to a stranger who does things that my husband would be mortified to have done.

In an effort to give back to those that have helped me I have filed for a non profit organization that I am calling the ‚ÄúFriends of Minds‚Äù foundation.  I am still about 10 weeks at least away from a decision from the IRS so I am not asking for donations.

The  vision is to connect people that have experience with a brain injury with people who get new brain injuries so that the journey doesn‚Äôt feel so lonely. Kind of like an AA for brain injuries but without the anonymity.

I am reaching out to anyone here that has a brain injury that would either like to receive help or perhaps provide help to someone with a new brain injury.  I would also like to point out that even though you may think you are not where you want to be in your recovery you still possess invaluable insight into what it‚Äôs like to have a brain injury. And therefore you can be very impactful in someone else‚Äôs life. 

If you are interested in getting involved either to get help or to try to provide help please send me an email with your name and then anything you want to tell me about yourself to connectingfriendsofminds@gmail.com.

Edit: I know from experience that sending an email can be challenging so if you want to PM me Bc that‚Äôs easier I am totally Ok with that. Cheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/lh7jv4/looking_for_friends/,Looking for friends,,25,6,0.97

Anyway, I'm a family member of a stroke victim. To make a long story somewhat short, my mom had a minor stroke three years ago and then two years ago she had a major stroke. She's completely paralyzed. The most she can do is move her left hand and she's right-handed. She can't talk or eat on her own. 

My mom was being taken care of by her sister since she was living with her sister when the stroke happened. My aunt is not a nurse but she learned the basics and got help three times a week where an actual nurse came. 

My aunt has a history with drug abuse specifically meth addiction and has been sober and relapsed a handful of times. 

I'm married to someone in the military and the military moved us overseas. I put a lot of trust in my aunt to continue to take care of my mom. Before I saw my mom as often as I could, on her birthday and holidays like Christmas since we lived in separate states. Now I haven't seen my mom since August 2017. 

I got pregnant with my son in October 2017. I asked my aunt to tell my mom and as far as I knew she told her but I didn't know I was having a boy yet. 

In April 2018 my aunt relapsed and stopped taking care of my mom. There were signs of not only neglect but abuse as well. My aunt was arrested. My mom was taken to a hospital to assess further damage and then she was put into long term care. 

It's been really difficult to be dealing with this when I'm so far away. I'm also an only child so the burden is put on my shoulders. I've been in charge of signing consent orders on her behalf since I'm her only next of kin. 

It's also hard not being able to just call her and talk to her. I don't even know if she knows I had my baby. Or what her grandsons name is. I know no one has visited her since I gave birth to him. When we are able to fly back to the states for a visit I'll definitely visit her. But it's just been very emotionally challenging dealing with these changes and being far away. I think of my mom every day  but theres a part of me that has emotionally shut down because one of my biggest fears is getting a phone call saying my mom has passed and I wasn't able to see her one last time. I think it's easier on me mentally if I block it out and don't think about it or talk about it. I have friends and family ask how my mom is and I just shrug because I don't know how to answer. And I don't want to tell them either when they could easily go see her and find out for themselves. 

So I'm glad I found this subreddit so I can vent and might actually talk to someone who knows how I feel. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/a0vyrf/its_awesome_something_like_this_subreddit_exists/,It's awesome something like this subreddit exists,,25,2,0.97

He‚Äôs a very fun and loves to joke, cook and we are super close to him. It horrible to see him like this and I don‚Äôt know what to do to lift his spirit. He had an hemorrhagic stroke and is paralyzed all of his right side. It broke our heart to see him struggling and I can see in his eyes the pain (mentally) he's going through of being ‚Äústuck‚Äù in his body.

Doctor says they can't give any prognostic because it is too early. For what we know only is that he had a hemoragy in the brain and that it can't be operated. Other than that we don't know anything about the future.

My mom, sister and I trying to put a brave face and be there for him which is ironic because I can see that my dad is trying to make a joke even if he can barely talk. He tries to make us less worried but I don't want him to feel he need to pressured himself to be ‚Äústrong‚Äù.  

I'm sad because it's my best friend and we love to cook and do projects together, he's truly the spirit of the house and is the most generous person I know. What can I do to help him to stay strong and make his life easier?

It's also depressing not to know what‚Äôs next. When I see the rates of life after a stroke at his ages its depressing. My mom has a bit of a issue with emotion and copes very bad with bad thoughts and I know if thing turn badly she will probably be really really bad. 

I feel very guilt because 24h ago I had no idea what was really a stroke and if ny mother hadn't been there I would have probably waited because he's said his just feeling weird.

I am happy to hear jokes about serious things (I am an amateur comedian working on a stand up about my experience), if they come from a good place. But this just feels lazy.

14ta9m8,stroke,1688743316.0,"I still can't believe that any of this is real, but an MRI has incidentally found an ""old stroke"". They can't tell me how old though which really sucks.

I went to the ER in April 2021 and Dec 2022 for symptoms that I was later told resembled migraine with aura. Both incidents started with a bright ring of light in my right eye (about 20 mins), progressed to communication/speech/reading disabilities (for about an hour) and ended with a headache (that lasted many hours). The precursor to both incidents was that I was super dehydrated.

The ER doctor in April 2021 was damn sure that this was migraine with aura. I was convinced with his explanation and decided not to do a CT scan. (I was diagnosed with migraine as a teenager, so it made sense to me that it was a migraine)

The ER doctor in Dec 2022 told me that he's never seen such a migraine and asked me to do a CT scan. There was nothing found in the CT scan. He asked me to follow up with a Neurologist.

I followed up with a Neurologist in May 2023 and he was also convinced that both incidents resembled classic migraine with aura symptoms. He wanted me to do an MRI to rule out anything else. I got the MRI done last week and now, here we are with the stroke diagnosis.

I'm really confused cause I don't have any lasting neurological symptoms. I also don't seem have any permanent damage to my motor skills or anything like that.

I'm still not sure if the two incidents I experienced were migraines or not. I'm leaning towards migraines cause I didn't have any of the ""classic"" stroke symptoms (like weakness in arm, face dropping, paralysis etc.). Both incidents did not leave any sort of permanent damage either.

Some background about my health:
1. Smoked cigarettes between 2009 - 2017 (a pack a day)
2. Smoked e-cigarettes between 2017 - now (Heavy everyday use). Just quit 3 days ago ever since finding out about the stroke)
3. Heavy alcohol drinking between 2009 - 2015. Slowed down a lot between 2015 - 2021. Haven't had a drop of alcohol since Jan 2021.
4. I'm at a highly stressful job (Since Oct 2021) that has caused me to gain a lot of weight (+40 pounds since I joined). I've been hitting the gym this last month and have managed to drop about 7 pounds.

12ys2it,stroke,1682448204.0,"Dear survivors and family members. All along we've been educated non-stop on the signs of stroke when the ischemia is happening (e.g. FAST) in order to send our loved ones to the hospital ASAP before extensive brain damage happen to prevent permanent disability. That's not what I want to talk about today. I'm genuinely curious, for someone at a high risk of stroke, are there more earlier warning signs before the actual event of a stroke?

&#x200B;

To give you a better analogy of my question, think of another ischemic-related emergency like heart attack. Many patients experience chest pain on high exertion or emotional stress. If the stressor is removed, an actual heart attack does not happen. So that's like a warning sign that a person's prone to heart attack before the real deal. As for stroke, the typical slurred speech/paresis on one side usually mean that stoke already happened.  


In other words, is there any stroke equivalent of heart pain (angina pectoris)? Have you ever felt ""strange"" or weaker (maybe the occasional headaches, dizziness due to reduced blood flow to the brain) before your actual stroke? If you went for a your usual jog do you get a headache/dizziness easily?

&#x200B;

I understand that there are risk factors such as cholesterol levels, blood sugar, blood pressure, age, weight etc. but right now let's put that aside and focus on the possible early warning signs (not FAST), if there's any.

skl1gp,stroke,1644000556.0,"I had 3 strokes in 2019, all within the same week just two months after my 30th birthday.  I'm not going to lie, life post-stroke has been hard.  Life before was no cakewalk either, but having a stroke has presented me with a whole host of new obstacles to overcome in life.

I am finally starting to get my head above water here.  I have fallen into a daily routine, and I do alright on days in which that routine is not disrupted too much.  I take medication 4x daily (mainly vertigo medication, since 2/3 of my strokes were cerebellar).  I wake up, make myself some coffee, and sit down for 2-3 hours while my body/mind adjust to being awake.  I then attempt to get some work done.  


I couldn't return to my job as a caregiver.  I can no longer drive, and I require headphones with constant noise cancellation to tolerate being out in public, since I now have a massive amount of sensory issues that can trigger a panic attack at any moment.  I can't get disability, because let's face it... the American government does not care how many strokes you how mentally frail you've become.  Unless you're bedridden, you're going to have a ridiculously difficult time getting disability - especially at my age.  


I started my own business working from home.  I've utilized my heightened sensitivity to smell to create oil-based perfumes that bring people joy.  My business is already taking off.  I never would have even considered doing something like this if it weren't for my strokes.  I feel far more fulfilled than I did in my caregiving job, and I'm able to work at my own pace.  My parents have supported me by paying a small amount of rent to my live-in boyfriend every month.  By the end of the year, I'm hoping I'll be making enough money to pay it myself.  


I met my boyfriend 7-8 months into my stroke recovery.  He might have missed my journey learning how to walk and use my hand again, but he has witnessed me make massive amounts of improvement in other facets of my life.  I was incredibly mentally and emotionally unstable before I met him.  He has helped keep me grounded and given me a reason to keep fighting when I feel like giving up.  I feel like giving up frequently, and I have to take the time to refocus on what's important to me in life.  It's much easier said than done, but I take it day by day.

I just want others struggling with life post-stroke to know that life does go on.  You have to learn to roll with the punches.  Depression is 6x more common 2-3 years after a stroke, when the reality of your situation begins to truly set in.  The vast majority of stroke survivors do not make a full recovery.  You will almost certainly have residual effects, even after years of hard work.  You have to make the best of what you have.  Focus on what's important to you.  Just keep swimming.  I'm not sure why I'm resorting to Finding Nemo quotes here, but Dory had a pretty good outlook.

Best wishes to all my fellow stroke survivors just trying to get by, especially in these winter months when aches and pains are at their peak and the sun is often nowhere to be found.  Keep fighting for what's important to you.  Put something good out into the world.  Compliment a stranger.  Make art.  Hug your family.

pz4h1y,stroke,1633080781.0,"Sorry for my grammar I'm still a little off since the stroke. Waking up in the ICU dazed and confused on why you're trapped in this room. You can't move and you can't scream. You know something's wrong but you can't comprehend anything but pain.

You lay there with tears in your eyes and pain in a voice you can never speak, just wondering to yourself where did everything go wrong? Why am I broken? Why am I in this godforsaken room? Did I deserve this? I probably did because I'm a fucking bastard. You hear this faint almost incoherent voice, telling your family that you might not fully recover and you might be bedridden in this close to an almost vegetative state, you want to yell and tell them you're ok and that it's nothing, but the words won't come out and you don't even know what the fuck is happening, and that the darkness of the world of pain and torment begin to take over.

It's been three days and you're moving and grumbling, a mess of a man. You finally learn that you had an AVM that finally burst and caused a hemorrhagic stroke. That you're lucky that it happened when you were young, but to be truly lucky is for it to not even burst. You feel you're whole life the world was out to get you, and even your fucking brain tried to kill you. Nurses and even your family force you to eat, nothing stays down and you just constantly vomit all over yourself like a child. You're unable to use utensils because the stroke damaged both sides of your brain. With all the vomiting you managed to lose 40 pounds in the month you were in the ICU. You almost died choking on your vomit, because of being transferred to a different wing you were required to wear a mask. You started throwing up, but the vomit is trapped behind the confines of your mask and you're too weak to even remove the mask and flip yourself over. Lucky for you a nurse sees you shaking and she saves your life.

The constant state of being in pain or drugged off your mind is slowly killing your sanity. You start seeing hallucinations on the fifth day, these shadows with no face or no form like phantoms and death himself waiting for you to die. The hallucinations that scare you the most are the ones of the girl you love dead; no life in her beautiful brown doe eyes, her bronze skin now pale, and her smile that tells you everything is going to be ok is now empty. The one hallucination that fucks you is your childhood abuser ready to violate you again, you can feel their presence and you can feel everything. You're in a world with 7 billion people but somehow you're alone lost in the ocean of sorrow.

It's been a month and you'd been transferred to stroke rehab, it's a great place with amazing staff, but it's humiliating; you fell twice in the ICU so now you're a fall risk who can't leave his bed unless it's supervised or you're going to one of the therapies. Every time you dress you are watched by a nurse, every bathroom visit, and the most damaging to you every shower you have to be watched. You used to play the guitar and piano, you had elegant and swift fingers that played beautiful melodies, after talking to multiple doctors, you learn that maybe you might not fully recover your fingers or even worse unable to play the instruments that you spent forever to learn and that made you so happy.  You think to yourself that you deserved it. Life wanted you miserable and alone, and you challenged life and well life almost killed you with a stroke to humble yourself. The hallucinations are starting to taper off but you still have them and even to this day when your brain is overwhelmed.

The PTSD makes it almost impossible to sleep in any room, my brain just associates any small confined place with a bed as ""ICU"" I learned to accept that I will get vivid and horrid hallucinations from time to time. The one I never learned about was the joint pain, every day my body aches and burns like a fire, it's hard to even move most days.

Update? Honestly, guys I don't know why I'm doing this, life is always just going to be terrible. There was promises and plans and well they're gone, my back from my injury is starting to hurt and I was almost close to throwing up blood again. I'm on this perpetual rollercoaster and I just want to step off. I have zero friends and no social life I don't even talk to anyone. Most my days are just be training and crying for a future I won't enjoy. Seems like everyone just revels in my misery. No one remembers cowards and that's good for me.

Post-stroke fatigue (or neurofatigue) is common, and it‚Äôs hard to predict whether it will completely go away. Neurofatigue has been described as ""brain fog,"" like walking through Jello, or complete exhaustion with little output. It can be incredibly frustrating.

Using energy conservation and activity pacing strategies can make it easier to do things you want and need to do. These strategies are not a quick fix. But by doing a little planning, you can still accomplish a lot! Use the 4 P's to remember these strategies:

1. **Prioritize:** Think about the activities that you need or want to do. Start with the most important and put off less important things if you have to.
2. **Plan:** Plan your day to avoid extra trips. Plan for the week so you can give yourself rest days. Try to get a good night's rest.
3. **Pace:** Slow and steady wins the race. Don‚Äôt feel like you have to rush to get things done. Take rest breaks when you need them. Ask for help if you need it.

jrqyh1,stroke,1605034452.0,"Hey all, I just created an account and I wanted to share my story since other's stories were so helpful for me when I was in the thick of everything. Last year at age 22, I had a right vertebral artery dissection, which formed a clot that went to my occipital lobe. I have upper left quadrantanopia as a result, which is field of vision blindness from the 9-12 hours on a clock face. 

So it began in March of 2019, when I went on a college spring break/study abroad trip to Hong Kong nearing the end of my senior year. The weeks leading up to the trip were incredibly stressful and I wasn't sleeping well, and feeling sore all over. On the plane there, I began to have massive headaches and desperately felt like I needed to crack my neck. In retrospect, I believe that the arterial tear was caused by my excessive straining to crack it, but sometimes there are just no real answers. Anyways, the trip continues, and I'm nauseous and laying in bed the majority of the time. I did some tourist things reluctantly, and even had a few clubbing nights, but I couldn't think clearly enough to work on the school project or function well. Around a day or two into the weeklong trip, my vision clouded/darkened/fuzzed/shimmered, kind of like if you were looking through an oil spill into the sky. I assumed that the 12 hour time zone change and the general feelings of sickness had caused me to have migraines with aura for the first time ever. I never considered going to the doctor's given that I was in completely foreign country.

The headaches didn't stop once I flew back to the states. I began to worry, and started visiting doctors after a few days. Between urgent care, the ER, and a primary visit, it took three or four tries before my primary physician suspected something was seriously wrong (because of my missing vision). She suspected a tumor, and an ophthalmologist did a field of vision test confirming loss of the upper left quadrant. At the end of April, a day before I graduated college, I had a cerebral angiogram through my groin, which found a narrowed right vertebral artery, indicating a healing vertebral dissection.

That summer/fall/winter was really tough, mentally. The physical recovery itself took time, like a few months, and I was confused, tired, and groggy all the time. I moved in with my boyfriend post-graduation and continued to work \~10 hours a week at a food shop, but I really was just waiting for the end. I gave up on everything, quit working towards a future, and lost all motivation. I withdrew from friends who had all left town to start jobs anyways, and I really tried to rely exclusively on myself and the internet for help. I sunk into a really deep place. My bf and I broke up in November 2019, in part (but not entirely) because of the strain of my dependency and depression. 

A week after that, I had a suspected TIA and spent a week in the hospital while they ran all kinds of tests, with no conclusions. Looking back I think I may have just had an anxiety attack, but that kinda happens a lot now and I'd rather be cautious. 

Upon release, I started an internship in a new city but still moped around. The pandemic hit, lost my internship, I moved home, got a job working at Walmart as a stocker in May. I started working on myself and trying to get mentally better through the summer. As of October I began a new internship remotely, and as of this month (November 2020) I quit working at Walmart to move to NYC.

To say this has all been a challenge would be an understatement. My stroke derailed everything I had going for me, and I'm only just feeling like I'm getting back on my feet. However, I'm really thankful I don't have more serious physical ailments from the stroke. I've done an incredible amount of personal growth, and I'm in a more emotionally secure spot than I ever have been. My blindness is something that ""bothers"" me daily, but I try to keep a good perspective on things, and it feels like my life is on a forward path again now, 1.5 years post the-big-one. My advice to others who are going through this, especially if you're young like I am, is to be vulnerable about it with your friends and family even though they can't/won't understand, and to get professional help about your feelings. I can't advise on more physical recovery aspects, but I have learned that I just personally need to have patience that things will improve over time. I've thrown myself into my hobbies and interests, made new friends, moved cities, and generally tried to grow as a person since the beginning of this year even despite the pandemic, and I think that's made all the difference.

Once there they looked at my face and eyes, made me lift my arms and legs and did a CT scan. I had to be moved to another hospital nearby to get a brain MRI in the morning. They couldn‚Äôt see anything on the CT scan but thought the MRI might catch something.

The ER doc there seemed to be in a rush but after looking at my scans and giving me the same test, she would t give me a stroke diagnosis or even a TIA because she said I was too young, my left hand was still tingly, and she said with a TIA all the symptoms disappear. My headache was worse but besides the tingly fingertips I felt fine, just tired. She did say I had a lesion on my left parotid gland that needed an ultrasound and to see a neurologist for the tingling.

They sent me home but the headache never left. I‚Äôm still tired. I feel that it might have been a TIA, but because of my age she simply didn‚Äôt want to call it. I think she was in too much of a rush to give me a proper diagnosis. I have to take baby aspirin now. I talked to my PCP but I‚Äôm not sure when she‚Äôll get back to me.

He was intubated and unconscious/sedated for a few days, and the week after that I feel like I was told he was going to die about 4 times by doctors and to prepare for it. It's been really hard. 

Luckily, against all odds, he didn't die and He's now since been extubated, he can speak well, he's eating dental soft foods on his own now, which is the level right under a regular diet, and he's now in acute physical therapy at the hospital. His memory is intact, his speech is intact, he can write with his right hand and can operate his laptop fairly well as of today. His left side is still extremely weak, but he can lift his left leg and he sits up a lot straighter now. He seems to be improving every day, little by little. 

The thing that's been the hardest, is not being able to help him. He's not sleeping well, because who does at a hospital, which then triggers confusion because hes already exhausted from the intense physical therapy he has every day. 

This evening he texted me and then called me on my cell asking me to get him from the attic because he was locked up there. I had to remind him that he's safe in his bed in the hospital and to look out his door and see the nurses station. The good news is that's the first time he was able to operate his cellphone and not only text a coherent message but find my name in his phone and call me, but his confusion freaked me out and I've spent the evening crying. I didn't expect him to text or call, for one, and I was heartbroken that he thought he was locked in the attic.

I just want my dad to be okay and I feel embarrassed for feeling sorry for my self because of how hard this is because it's so much worse for my dad. But I feel helpless. 

I have to figure out a living situation for us when he gets released because his house has stairs so that means selling the house and finding one that works, but I don't have down-payment money besides what we get for his house. I've never sold or purchased a house before so I'm also thrust into this situation. It's all so much and I'm so overwhelmed. 

I know this wa mostly me venting but does the confusion get better? Is it triggered by exhaustion? During the day he's lucid and is cracking jokes and doing well but when he gets tired either in the morning or later in the evening, he starts getting confused.

CT showed a bleed. Thankfully, another CT 24 hours later showed no change, meaning the bleeding was not ongoing.

I already had a lot of improvement after one day. The numbness was limited to a bit of my lips, nose and right hand. Everything else was mostly back to normal.

For my right hand, I can't really feel anything. Can't tell if my fingers are holding something or not. I have to keep my eyes on it when I use it. And you can't imagine how many typos I'm making trying to type this out.

17mf8zm,stroke,1698962924.0,"So, I'm writing this to get the thoughts out of my head in a place filled with people who may understand. 

6 weeks ago, my (29F) mum (60F) had a massive stroke that took her right sight of her body. Her mental faculties were thankfully mostly unaffected.

Last weekend, she had another that left her with only minimal left leg and left elbow movement. She is now for all intents and purposes, a quadriplegic. It turns out this is all secondary to a really rare vasculitis (and at one point they'd even been considering a really rare form of lymphoma - intravascular lymphoma, but it isn't that) and treatment was started too late.

Anyhow, i know everyone says not to wallow on the past and on the future maybes, but right now, i need to voice them. Scream them, shout them. Cry them. Because it hurts so much and I am so scared of losing even more of her if she has another. Weirdly also knowing she's not dying but not going to get much better is horrific. I don't want her dead, but she is nearly a vegetable, and she's told me she hates it and is scared.

She is never going to walk again. The woman who used swimming to survive through losing her husband 22 years ago is never going to be able to be in a pool alone again, and she nay even never again get in one.

She is never going to be able to tuck that loose strand of hair behind my ear on my wedding day and smile with a wistful smile.

She's never going to dance with me or be able to hug me properly ever again. 

She is never going to be able to hold any future children of mine, hug them, cradle them, just to give me a break when I'm desperate for some sleep. 

She's never going to be able to bake or drive or hoover the lounge, shower herself, or even brush her own teeth ever again.

I know she doesn't want to be a burden, and it's destroying her emotionally. It shattered my heart into more pieces than I thought possible. 

I'm terrified of her friends drifting away because she can't even pick up the phone to call or text. 

We had to discuss a DNR the other day, and I've never seen that look in my mums eyes before and... I just... I don't know if I can do this. I don't know if she can do this. 

Devastated isn't enough to begin to describe it. I thought not knowing what was wrong was awful, but this? This feels like cruel torture, and I just have almost not stopped cried for days. 

I just needed to say it because no one else is listening or wants to hear, or if they are, they can't handle it, and I end up comforting them.

I'm so grateful for a wonderful boyfriend supporting me, but it's hard knowing he hates seeing me this way. I know I'm withdrawing. I feel like a shell. I am seeking professional help, but tonight, I just had to put pen to paper because if I don't, I really will break. 

Sending so much love and healing prayers and thoughts to you all whom I've been reading on here recently. X x x

17foiqj,stroke,1698184348.0,"In February 2021, my 63 year old father suffered a severe stroke that paralyzed his right side and made him 99% mute (he could only say 3 to 4 words like ""yes"", ""no"", and ""whoa""). I had moved back home a couple of years before due to some financial issues. He was fine the night before except he complained of a headache. I didn't think nothing of it, because he routinely suffered from migraines. Apparently he hadn't been seen since 6:00 am the next day when he clocked in and left for his truck route.  I went home early to start searching for him and he was found behind a retail store. We found out that he had suffered a major stroke while at work (he drove a trash truck) and nobody checked up on him until my mom tried to get a hold of him.  My mom and I both worked second shift and we were unaware of what was going on. Like I said, he was fine when he left. We were both pissed off at his place of work for not checking up on him on a regular basis.  He was left stranded out in the cold for 12 hours!  Luckily, he was bundled up quite well. He couldn't answer his phone or have Siri answer it for him.

He's been in a nursing home for the last 2 and a half years with minimal recovery until yesterday.  He can say a few words. He can feed himself. His whole right side is paralyzed. He can still laugh at dirty dad jokes. He was quite stubborn with therapy for the longest time and the nursing home stopped it for several months while he was getting approved for insurance. His physical therapist also told us that his stroke was so severe that he will most likely not regain movement or his speech.  Just recently, he started to show signs that he's ready to start speech therapy again. He had attempted to talk.  Yesterday, my mom informed me that out of the blue, he said her name and then started counting with his fingers to show her what he had relearned. He had been saying the same 3 to 4 words since his stroke and now all of a sudden regained a few move words.  She asked him if he's been having speech therapy again and he said yes.  

I am trying to remain positive. I had accepted his fate, but now I feel more positive that there's a chance that he might regain his speech.  His movement might be a different story, but I will never lose hope.

I went through inpatient rehab to walk again using a walker, got out to go home soon after, went up to a cane with further physical therapy and then nothing. My right hand (my dominant) took even longer to get this far, and my left eye is still out, which is no good since it was the better one before this happened. I ate poorly, that was it, and my body decided 'whoopsies, time to have a stroke'. I'm an IT tech and a major gamer, as well as tabletop game player, so one can imagine how important sight is to me. My typing used to be at 90+ words per minute, now it's 60+. I can't even watch TV, relying on audio and what I can vaguely see. This eye problem is holding me back. I might have a supportive job and really supportive parents, and I'm grateful I'm able to walk and type again, but I've been miserable without my main hobbies, and the eye therapy will take another 6/7 months.

If she cannot find another position she will have to go back to her old position in kitchen service, which if she cannot perform sufficiently, she is given 90 days.

I'm just pissed because she is being tossed under the bus. The doctors won't admit it, but she was taken off blood thinners for a week before a medical procedure last year, and the day after that procedure, she had a stroke.

Her cardiologist admitted to me that 7 days was far too long considering the clots she has. As you can see, I'm agitated about all this considering her employer is showing zero mercy.

On January 23rd, my Dad began feeling numb and weak on his left side. He went to his PCP and he sent him for a scan of his bladder and kidneys, and for a scan of his lumbar spine. They found two herniated discs and blamed that for the numbness. His PCP said if it gets worse, go to the ER. It got worse everyday but he kept working, because that‚Äôs who he is! He went to one ER on February 3rd (they asked him why he was even there and actually refused to examine him), another on February 4th (they wouldn‚Äôt admit him, even though he said it was getting worse. Sent him home on steroids. They said to make an appointment with an orthopedic doctor), and then February 5th came. He woke up with numbness and weakness on both his left and right side. He could only communicate, ‚Äúcall 911.‚Äù He was rushed to the third different hospital, where they immediately did an MRI. He had 98% blockage of his right carotid artery and 100% in the left. They then found that he had a watershed stroke. They transferred him to a different hospital and scheduled surgery for Wednesday

We didn‚Äôt get to Wednesday because on Monday, I watched my father have a second stroke. He was doing great that day too! PT and speech therapy came in and he walked to the bathroom all on his own. He fed himself lunch and made us leave so we can get lunch too. He finished his whole meal, including his ice cream, his favorite food! He told us he wanted to move to the bed to take a nap. He woke up an hour later and just stared at my Mom‚ÄîI‚Äôll never forget his face. He tried to get out of bed, like he was going somewhere. He only replied, ‚Äúokay‚Äù to everything we said. So, I jumped up and held my 61 year old father as he tried to get up. My mom pressed to nurses button but I just yelled at her to hold him in place while I ran to the nurses station. The rapid response team came in‚Äîthere were so many people. I held his hand the entire time though. I just talked to him, I knew in his eyes he was scared. I told him how much I love him, that we had to go see Ant-man this month, and that he had to walk me down the aisle. After that, he was rushed to surgery and a stent was placed. I hold so much anger for the surgeon and all of the ER‚Äôs that didn‚Äôt care. I can‚Äôt help but think, what if one of those doctors actually heard him out? What if the doctor did the surgery earlier? I wouldn‚Äôt have had to see my Dad like that. Now I can‚Äôt stop picturing it. 

He knew something was wrong with his body, he cried almost everyday. He was scared. He knew. He called me the day before his first stroke. He told me how much he loved me, and I promised we would find out what‚Äôs wrong. I kinda wish they never found the herniated discs. Maybe someone would‚Äôve heard him out. The left side of his brain is just‚Ä¶ destroyed. He was sedated and intubated two days after the surgery. He‚Äôs on the ventilator now and they scheduled a surgery for a feeding tube and tracheotomy. Every doctor tells us something different. Some give me hope, some tell me not to have hope. He opens his eyes and looks right at us. I swear he even noticed the ventilator, looked at me, and his face turned red like he was about to cry. He moves his left side around constantly, they have him strapped down on that side so he doesn‚Äôt rip out the ventilator! He‚Äôs always had trouble sleeping and is sooo fidgety in his sleep‚Äîhe‚Äôs hit my mom a few times in the middle of the night! I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs moving like his old self, at least on one side. They told us he‚Äôs restless at night and gave him fentanyl two nights in a row to calm him down. He‚Äôs restless because he‚Äôs scared. When he gets restless when I‚Äôm there, I hold his hand. He calms down for me. 

I needed to share what happened to him with people who know the severity of situations like these. Our family and friends tell us that he‚Äôll get better soon but how can he get better if a doctor just told me, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs never going to be the man that you remember‚Äù? I guess I‚Äôm just wondering, am I dumb to have hope? Will he ever respond to commands? I tell him to open his eyes and he does, and he moves his head as if he‚Äôs double checking it‚Äôs me. Don‚Äôt you think looking me right in the eyes, moving an arm and leg, squeezing the stuffed dog I brought for him are all good signs?

We cant see you, hear you or know your medical history: are you overweight, do you have diabetes, are you a smoker/drinker, do you do drugs, do strokes run in your family and do you have a blood disease? These can all play a factor in figuring out you are having a stroke, plus many more things I didn't name. Literally the stroke term used is called BE FAST (Balance, Eyes, Face, Arms, Speech and TIME!)  With that being said do not seek medical advice on this group because you are only jeopardizing your own health at that point.

You know your body best and I will tell you from my experience, not just with stroke but any injury that you will know that there is something wrong with you so, go to the closest hospital or call your emergency line.

My aphasia is gone, which was so challenging, and so has the weakness in my leg. However, I‚Äôve had constant numbness and tingling in my right foot and hand since the stroke. It actually used to be my entire right side, but it faded over time to the point where now it‚Äôs only my foot and three fingers and hasn‚Äôt improved since (in the past 3 months). It‚Äôs been almost a year living with constant pins and needles, weird perceptions of hot and cold, extremely sensitive to the touch, and an inability to feel textures. I know I am lucky to have recovered so much, and that things could have been much much worse. But I feel very alone in my struggle now. Since the weakness in my leg resolved, my remaining symptom is ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù in that people can‚Äôt tell anything is wrong, even though I am constantly uncomfortable and constantly reminded of that horrible day I had my stroke. People always say ‚Äúoh well that‚Äôs not bad‚Äù when I tell them I still have symptoms. Even my family! Which makes me feel very alone. Not to mention no one else I know had a stroke at this age and so no one can relate. My neurologist seems to not be taking this symptom seriously, telling me to just ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù and seemingly not believing how bothersome it is to live with. 

As it‚Äôs coming up to a year, I‚Äôm worried that this may be permanent for me. I wanted you reach out and ask if anyone else has experienced something similar?

At my last follow up with the neurosurgeon she explained some things to me that answered a lot of questions about what I was experiencing post hospital. I was told I was closer to dieing then I ever will be without being dead. They did not expect me to survive. She said that a SAH effects every part of your body, every organ is effected. Your body knows you are dieing and starts try to fix it. All the  dopamine and serotonin is dumped into your system immediately. Many people have to go on antidepressants because of this. Your heart has to recover from the stress it was under as well as your lungs and kidneys. Everything cell in the body is effected and takes up to a year or more to  recover.

The blood pressure on my head was so severe that I was throwing up, feeling weak everywhere, then hearing a loud beeping noise and I remember nothing after that. A day later I woke up at the hospital and I was told that I had two strokes one on each side of the head. I did not go in an ambulance, my girlfriend carried me all the way to the car and took me to the hospital while freaking out, and she also has a ton of problems with her health, problems with her heart and white blood cells, so I do not know how she summon the strength to do that while she can't even open a pickle jar. I owe her my life. I owe my life to everyone who have supported me so far. 

But even with all that said, this is not the end of the strokes, as being diagnosed with an awaken condition called Moyamoya, and having head surgery on both sides of the head, I am now suddenly dealing with things I never experienced in my life, and everytime I seek someone who has this condition, it is very rare to find them, and when I do read about them, we all have kind of different symptoms. 

My tinnitus being the most aggressive one,  as I can hear it almost 24/7 whenever there is no noise around. My memory has short fuses, as if some thoughts escape me. My head shakes silently and it sounds like a refrigerator running, even if I ask people if it is moving, they will say no. Sudden tiredness, blood vessels can't be overworked with moyamoya. I used to be someone who heavy lift , now I can't even lift a garden chair or I will feel like I will have a stroke. I had an epilepsy playing a video game while on stream, it nearly made me faint.

ng553v,stroke,1621429135.0,"**N is for neuroplasticity.**

Neuroplasticity is one of my favorite topics. Not only because I get to nerd out about neuroscience-y stuff, but it's a huge reason that recovery takes place after someone has a brain injury!

So what is neuroplasticity?  
‚Äã  
Imagine that a person is taking the train to work and has to switch trains twice on their route.

But today, they find that the second train is out of commission and this person has to find a new train route that will take them to work.

Instead of panicking, they look at a map of the train system. They realize there are multiple routes they could take and try one out today.

It goes well and they try a different route the next day until they find one that works well for them.

After a stroke, the injured area of the brain is like that out-of-commission train car.

**Neuroplasticity is the map** we use to try and find other existing routes to get to a destination. Those new routes are established through motor learning by **being actively involved in recovery and repetition.**

If you'd like to learn more about how to use neuroplasticity in your recovery, check out my blog article [Neuroplasticity: The Best Stroke Recovery Tool.](https://elysenewland.com/articles/neuroplasticity-the-best-stroke-recovery-tool)

n3w3o9,stroke,1620048659.0,"As you may know, May is National Stroke Awareness Month in the United States (where I'm located). I made and shared a video last week explaining [what a stroke is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JW6Q3oIkc8&t=3s). This is the first in a ""Basics of Stroke"" video series I'm currently working on for Stroke Awareness Month.

On social media, I'll be going through the ABCs of stroke to raise awareness as well.  

Let's start with ""A!""

**A is for aneurysm & arteriovenous malformation.**

A brain **aneurysm** is a weakened blood vessel that ends up bulging and sometimes ruptures, which can lead to a hemorrhagic stroke. The American Heart Association notes that aneurysms develop over time and are more common in people over 40. They often develop due to high blood pressure.

Aneurysms grow slowly and weaken as they enlarge. It‚Äôs unknown how to predict when or if they will rupture. High blood pressure can weaken arteries, and straining can increase blood pressure.

An **arteriovenous malformation (AVM)** is something that people are usually born with. They occur in less than 1% of the population, according to Harvard Health. An AVM consists of an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins.

* **Arteries** bring blood that is rich in oxygen from the heart to the rest of the body.
* **Veins** transport the blood that has delivered the oxygen (and now needs to be oxygenated) back to the heart.
* **Capillaries** are tiny vessels that connect arteries and veins. They also exchange nutrients from the blood to surrounding tissues.

An AVM changes and disrupts this natural process. It connects arteries directly to veins and completely bypasses capillaries. These fragile, tangled vessels can become damaged over time. This can lead to blood vessel rupture and resulting hemorrhage.

mzajl1,stroke,1619478135.0,"Hello, friends. I (30M) was told by my neurologist Friday that since my last MRI 7 years ago, it appears that I have had a ""small stroke"" in the cerebellar region of my brain. Obviously we are getting lots of testing done over the next couple of weeks and I have follow-ups with all kinds of different doctors. However, I have severe medical anxiety and hearing that I had had a stroke is literally one of my worst fears. I don't remember having any symptoms and I have no impairments but I am still terrified now that I will have a symptomatic stroke in the coming months. Sleeping has been hard, I live alone so I'm constantly worried I won't be able to call for help if I need it, etc. But my neurologist acted so nonchalant about it! Am I just overthinking all of this? It also bugs me to no end that there's no way to tell when this stroke happened - it could have been 6 months ago or 6 years ago! To top it off, I have migraines with aura which only worsens my anxiety about having a stroke since the symptoms are so stroke-like. I am going crazy with all of this.

I'm hoping after all the testing, following up, etc., etc., I will feel more reassured. I'm just struggling right now. I will say that since she told me about the stroke, I have changed my diet completely. I am currently following the DASH diet (though appetite is extremely low right now due to anxiety). I quit smoking 2 months ago for different reasons which my neuro says was probably the biggest preventative thing I could have done. I've been getting at least 30 minutes of walking in a day, and adding yoga and mindfulness practices to my day-to-day. Checking in with PCP and cardiologist to get mildly elevated BP under control as well as triglycerides, and getting an echo with bubble study and carotid doppler (but not until the end of May, which is adding to anxiety).

I have another happy update, and I feel like a lot of us need to read these type of posts every now and then here. Again, sorry if I make any grammar/language mistakes, English is not my first language. 

My dad had a stroke and a thrombosis in August 2021. He started recovering, and he doesn‚Äôt have any mobility problems. 

He has transcortical motor aphasia, and started going to therapy almost as soon as he got out of the hospital. Well, his doctor said that he was doing great and that he could stop going to sessions with her twice a week to once every few weeks online! She gave him an exercise book that he reads every day and has been improving so much. 

He says he still struggles with longer words and sometimes with conjugations, but we can understand what he‚Äôs saying most of the time. He went from speaking two or three words at a time to having full conversations with strangers in less than 2 years. 

Physically, he‚Äôs also great! He gained a few kilos he lost while in the hospital and goes for a walk every day, nothing too strenuous. 

I hope this can give someone an insight on how the brain can recover with time. It‚Äôs a slow process, but it‚Äôs possible. I again want to thank this community because it made me feel less alone when my dad was not conscious and while I was staying at the hospital.

Ambulance came fast and she got to the ER around 7 PM. Her blood sugar and blood pressure were extremely high but they were able to get it down and keep it down with meds.

There was a severe bleed deep in her basal ganglia so they can't operate on her unless it spreads elsewhere in the brain.

Today she got a little worse. They did a scan of her brain and the bleeding spread a bit more but they're not sure how much. And they had to intubate her bc she was having some trouble breathing. They gave her some sodium thing(?) to help with the brain swelling.

 She was so restless in the hospital bed that first night. Constantly tossing and turning, pulling her blankets up, trying to pull out her oxygen nose thing. She would groan and wince like she was in pain so they gave her some pain meds. It hurt so much to see her like that, she was perfectly normal hours before.

Every time she would look over at me with her good eye it hurt so much bc you can tell there isn't much thought behind her eye. 

She always struggled with hypertension and type 2 diabetes but she was so terrible at taking her meds bc she ""didn't like the way it made her feel.""

z3424q,stroke,1669246233.0,"Hello, I've never created a post here but I'm not sure where/how I could share and think out loud. This seems like it could be helpful to receive thoughts, too.  
In April 2021, I suffered a stroke, my first seizure, and fell into a coma. I ended up learning that I had an Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) and it had ruptured, hence the former. From the brain trauma, I got diagnosed with Aphasia as the injury had affected the language and speech area (words, reading, communication and expression is very hard). My cognition, is not the same, its a bit slower-- a bit less functional. I'm a student, have been studying undergrad, majoring in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. Very ironic.  
It has been a little over a year and a half. My recovery has been good, considering. I have a long ways to go. And, I recognize it takes a very long time and lots of motivation. All in all, patience. I've done well, I will continue to do so.   
I'm in a new lap of my recovery, though, in which I'm not sure where I can take more runs. And I know there are those ups and downs, during rehabilitation but I've just been hitting downs. I recently had moved back to my universities town and was enrolled for Fall of this year. A couple of days before class was starting, I unfortunately and unexpectedly had Status Epilepticus and ended up in the ER. So, I went from one seizure, to another, to another in increments of around 15 minutes. Tried doing the whole school thing for a couple of weeks and accepted that I was not mentally and emotionally equipped considering the multiple convulsions. No matter how much help I could receive from the student disabilities accommodations.  
It's been hard, I had thought I was ready and once again I'm having myself go on pause. I'm not sure where to go now, even who I am now. I've always been this functional student living for academia but I no longer can be her right now. And the worst is that this pause is all indefinite. 

So, here's the reason I'm even writing. Financially, I'm struggling. And I would like to find a position, a job, in which I can feel welcomed and comfortable with my disability. Something that allows for a safe rehabilitation and a healthy mental state with low-stress. With that, I need fulfillment, because I've left it. Almost as if there was a past life, almost as if all of my files have been lost, almost as if I was hijacked.

It breaks my heart because I cant see clients until I go back, and I was supposed to graduate this December and now it's being set back.

nge6in,stroke,1621451180.0,"Hello everyone, 
I just joined but I kind of wanted to ask a strange question, is it okay to ‚Äúmourn‚Äù my father who had a stroke, even though he‚Äôs still alive? 
My father had a stroke a day after his birthday 10 years ago, he survived this stroke but he was impacted very hard, i was very young.
He was in a coma for a month and when he woke up he lost almost all functions. He still stutters when he talks, cannot pronounce some words, needs a scooter chair for long distances, and needs to use a walking stick in the house. I just feel strange for mourning my prior to stroke father, because he‚Äôs alive (which I‚Äôm very grateful for.) I see other stroke survivors fully recovering where they can continue living normal lives, but sadly my father cannot. 
I remember prior to his stroke, him and I would pick berries, we made snow men, we played sports together. I remember my father brushing my hair, and I just miss not being able to do these things with him anymore. 
Although I was young when this massive stroke happened to my father, I still remember him walking, talking, doing activities, I remember him driving and going to work, I remember him being functional I guess. 

I love my father with all my heart, I just miss who he was, but I accept who he is today and even with the changes his stroke has made in him, my love for him will never change. 

I heard his voice prior to his stroke in an old video, and I cried. I just feel strange for mourning my father in a way but he is still alive. That video is what made me make this post. 

Is it strange to ‚Äúmourn‚Äù my stroke survivor father?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/nge6in/is_it_strange_to_mourn_my_stroke_survivor_father/,Is it strange to ‚Äúmourn‚Äù my stroke survivor father?,,22,20,1.0
mq2cen,stroke,1618320815.0,"I asked a couple of weeks ago on social media what questions survivors felt weren‚Äôt addressed enough during the rehab process.

Several people mentioned how difficult it is to deal with role change, grief, and acceptance. These are all interrelated issues and deserve to be talked about. I‚Äôve said it time and again, but mental health recovery is not addressed enough. Rehab focuses so heavily on physical functioning that mental health gets left in the dust.

I tackle each of these issues and how they relate to stroke recovery in my latest article: [Grief and Acceptance](https://elysenewland.com/articles/grief-and-acceptance).

mfvz9n,stroke,1617042290.0,"After a stroke, your brain is healing. This can lead to neuro fatigue. Neuro fatigue is very different from regular fatigue. It can feel like ""brain fog,"" like you're swimming through a sea of Jello, muscle exhaustion, that you need to sleep but you can't, or that you sleep for hours on end.

You have better days and worse days. You may be tempted to do as much as you can during the times you‚Äôre feeling really good, but this can lead to exhaustion. That fatigue may keep you out of commission for hours or days at a time.

It‚Äôs hard to convey this level of fatigue. It's also difficult to differentiate between regular and neuro fatigue to friends and family. Christine Miserandino, who lives with Lupus, created the [Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/). She did so to describe what it‚Äôs like living with chronic illness and fatigue. Here's an example of how to apply Christine's Spoon Theory:

You have ten spoons. Each spoon represents the energy you need to do an activity like take a shower, make a meal, go to a doctor‚Äôs appointment, etc. Certain activities may require two or three spoons.

Let's say you use two spoons on a shower in the morning, one spoon on getting dressed, and one spoon for grooming. That means that you‚Äôve already used almost half of your spoons for the day!

The rest of the day will take planning to use your remaining spoons.

You might need to do laundry, see a friend, and make dinner, but seeing a friend will take four spoons, and making dinner will take 2 spoons. This would use up your daily allotment of ten, so laundry doesn‚Äôt get done today. Tomorrow, when you start with ten fresh spoons, you‚Äôll have to plan around using up some of your spoons for laundry. And the cycle continues.

If you deal with neuro-fatigue, it's already frustrating to not finish what you need to do, when you need to it. It can be even more frustrating when those around you don't understand what you're going through.

If you haven't already shared how neuro fatigue impacts you with your loved ones, I challenge you to share sooner rather than later. Sharing will hopefully lessen your frustration and give your loved ones a window into your experiences. Use Christine's Spoon Theory to help you explain.

* ‚Äã[Ben Heck's Single-Handed Playstation 4 Controller](https://www.benheck.com/single-handed-playstation-4-controllers/) ($300) moves all the controls to either the left or right side so that you can play with one hand. Ben builds these controllers by hand and 3D prints the necessary components.
* ‚Äã[Evil Controllers Accessible Controller](https://www.evilcontrollers.com/accessible-controller-creator) for either X-Box One or PS4 is super customizable (Price Varies). I really like these because they don't look different from a typical X-Box or Playstation controller.

12 weeks ago I started having pain in my right arm. I thought it was just from the gym but one night I was sitting in bed and felt a sharp electric shock shoot up my right arm and into my head. After I felt ok but that night I woke up and felt pain and tingling in my right arm and slowly spreading down my right leg, from my thigh right to my toes. The next day I woke up with mild pain and numbness/weakness down my right arm and leg, and also numbness/tightness around my right eye and in my head, and it‚Äôs never gone away since.

I now get weird headaches and fatigue. It's hard to describe but I also get a weird light headed feeling when having conversations sometimes.

My uncle was getting ill and no one could figure out why, he went into hospital on the 8th, and on the 9th he had a big stroke while staying there. Turns out he had a TIA stroke a while back, not sure when.

From the 9th onwards he came and went, the stroke had done a lot of damage, he couldn't speak, both sides were difficult to move, the doctors said he would most likely have no chance of recovery. I came to visit him and the one day that he was semi-coherant he had locked eyes with me when I said I'd come back the next day to see him. I felt almost relieved to have that interaction with him.

Sadly though, during the night last night, he had another big stroke, and today while all the family were with him he passed away.

This subreddit gave me peace of mind and helped me feel more informed, and reading stories of rehabilitation and effort gave me strength. Although he's gone, I'm glad he isn't suffering now.

affoiu,stroke,1547352890.0,"Okay well.... let me start off with Hi there! I'm 26 and I had an ischemic stroke 5 days ago. Now I'm left with so many questions, a lot of fear and just wondering why this happened.

The night before I stayed up all night reading and I had a light headache around 4am but I get headaches from time to time and I could barely feel that I figured I could sleep it off. I drank a coffee around 6am and took my mom to work and then went to workout at the gym. I did some ab machines including this new one that makes you do hardcore crunches then some cardio. I started feeling tired so I went to the store and bought cereal and some gummie bears and decided I'm REALLY tired (I thought I was just crashing from not sleeping) so I decided not to finish my errands and went home. 

I wanted to take a shower and sleep, that was the plan. I was so unbelievably tired, I've never felt that before. I've been bone tired where your whole body just needs to rest... but this wasn't the same. So I sat down on my bed and played netflix I just wanted to rest a moment maybe nap for 15mins if I could but my head would hurt when I tried. So I ate some of the gummie bears since they were right next to me thinking the sugar would wake me up and decided to shower so I can really try to sleep. 

I remember feeling this weird zap in my head that made me stop eating the candy like maybe that was too much sugar and I stood up to head to the bathroom and my movement was uncoordinated, I bumped into some shoeboxes and I was SO confused by that, I don't just knock into things. So I got on my knee and picked up what fell and when I tried to get up... I kept coming down to my knee. I was still stuck on how I knocked my stuff over to really clue in that I wasn't standing and that was my objective. So I tried to stand and my left side was weak and numb, and I kept falling down and I couldn't even get to my knee. I was so confused by this. So i thought okay, I'm laying on my floor now, I'm really tired, maybe just rest and I'll be good. But I felt like I wouldn't be able to wake up on my own if i did that (As in, i'm a light sleeper and can rest for 20mins if I only want to nap a short while instead of oversleeping and i felt like i would oversleep). So I worked really hard to get my phone off my desk and to pull my gym bag attached to my doorknob to open my room door.

I got my phone, I contacted my mom saying I didn't feel well, and she told me to call 911. I did that, gave them my info. I was conscious, speech was fine, reasoning capabilities also fine. It was just the left side weakness and numbness that I noticed. I made it downstairs and on my porch when the ambulance arrived.

Took me to the hospital and they told me I had an acute ischemic stroke. Then the weakness and numbness occurred AGAIN and it was difficult lifting my arm it felt so heavy and this time the left side of my cheek felt numb... so they gave me a tpa and my symptoms resolved itself eventually. Then I was transferred to another hospital with a neuro stroke team. 

I had CT/MRI/bubble test done and what was found is that I may have had a blood clot in my neck that resulted in the clot they found in my brain that led to my stroke. They don't know the cause.... I'm still waiting on results from some bloodwork that may take a week or so. I know I don't have that heart condition PFO. (Also, I'm not overweight, don't smoke, don't take drugs, I barely drink since I don't go out much so why bother)They also performed an ultrasound on my right leg and neck that I complained felt somewhat uncomfortable (my neck kinda hurt bit stiff and my leg just felt not like it had a cramp but like it needed to stretch) that came back negative.... I am curious though if an ultrasound would find evidence of a dvt from 2 months prior? Or if a dvt could last a day or two and feel better when you walk on it and stretch it out?

And I'm also wondering if what if that zap I thought I felt after eating the candy was really a seizure or something? No one mentioned seeing a seizure on the scans but maybe that's something you have to specifically be looking for? And I didn't mention the candy thing bc tbh I was in shock about the whole ""youre 26 and you just had a stroke"" thing. I'm still not over it.

&#x200B;

I took a trip with my friend to asia in November and on the flight back I remember my right leg (calf and thigh) hurt, I wore snug leggings that I think were like compression leggings and I moved around on the plane and I hydrated because I didn't want a clot they say that can happen on long flights. it was a 16 hour flight and my leg hurt for probably half of it. I had minor relief after my leg got used to moving around but once I was able to get off the plane and have REAL movement the pain lessoned.  I don't remember having pain the next day though. If I did I would have def had it checked out. I also was experiencing tendonitis and that REALLY hurt on the flight but I made it through. So... I'm not sure if what happened was dvt??? Wouldn't it have hurt more and longer than a day? That was 2 months ago..... what if I had a blood clot from the flight and then it led to my stroke 2 months later... can that happen? Idk... the thought really scares me though because... I felt fine and what my body was this ticking time bomb. I started taking birth control again after that trip, but my doctors told me to stop taking it since those can have a side effect of strokes. I also have crohn's disease and high cholestrol. I'm on blood thinners and lipator, baby aspirin and humira for my crohns. 

I've had that light headache since hours before the stroke and have been taking Tylenol. The last two days I didn't take Tylenol and this morning I woke up with it hurting more than it has, and I had pain behind my eye and after i googled it the term ""brain aneurism"" came up so I started worrying about that... and I feel like... if I can have a stroke then anything is on the table. 

Doctors said I don't seem to have any deficits and besides the headaches and the occasional weird pains I'm feeling in my leg/neck/chest I feel alright. My energy is still a bit low but that will resolve itself. They said I don't have any restrictions and can go back to my normal routine and that its safe for me to fly. However I do not feel that way... I mean I'm on blood thinners now, I've found 2 bruises on me already and I'm supposed to fly to london in april with my friend I've never been and I was really excited but... I don't know if it's a good idea. Still time to figure that out though. 

&#x200B;

I had a stroke. I was VERY lucky. Not lucky enough not to have one, but lucky in so many ways considering the situation. I haven't cried about it since the first day, but I think I could have maybe died idk no one SAID that... they didn't say a lot of things... but I was in shock when they were talking to me so who knows. And I'm too scared to ask my mom who was there.... I know the whole thing really shook her up. I don't feel like living my life differently.... I still want to find a good job in my field, find a boyfriend, I don't know if I want to take trips anymore...

This on top of heart failure, a partially failed bypass, diabetes, DVT, and 2 other strokes.  

I brought her home. I don't know how long she has, what is just delirium from her stroke or if it's terminal delirium.

We've increased her meds but I pray to any God that exists to just have a shred of mercy and make it quick.

She doesn't and didn't deserve this. I love her so much and she won't be able to return to doing the things she enjoyed like taking hiking walks, playing video games, or just spending time with her dog.

I wanted so much more than this for her. Logically I know hospice was the right decision because what she has isn't a life.

I believe they managed to remove the clot and restore blood flow within the initial three hours. Luckily she was right across the street from the hospital and had just parked at work. 

The doctors still don‚Äôt know what caused the stroke, and they say that the damaged brain tissue was a large area. For now she seems to be herself, she has her attitude and she uses familiar gestures and phrases when she knows the words. She knows me and she remembered immediately that I was somewhere that wasn‚Äôt home and that her mother needed to contact me. She was gesturing and saying my name. When she saw me she recognized me, she knows my name and she knows she loves me and she knows who we are to each other. She seems to have all her memories, she knows who her favorite Fortnite streamer is and she can open tumblr on her phone with her left hand and scroll. But she has a hard time saying certain words even though her brain can comprehend what she wants to say. But she‚Äôs made amazing progress since yesterday. 

She‚Äôs very determined and says a lot of things about wanting everything to work faster. She has a few phrases she sticks like ‚Äúeverything right now‚Äù and ‚Äúyes.‚Äù to and it seems from hour to hour she can say more but the physical is slower going.

My left side was mostly affected, and I‚Äôve been taking physiotherapy to improve my walking, balance and coordination.

¬†

I wanted to share and also gain insight from other survivors who may or may not have the same experience as I did.

* The constant dizziness. It has lifted mostly but there are days where you just have to fight it.
* The fatigue. At first, I couldn‚Äôt explain it, it‚Äôs like my body has just given up and wants to rest even in a middle of a task. Oddly, if I sit or lie down, I‚Äôll be more tired but If I decide to go for a walk, I‚Äôll have more energy.
* The random headaches. It makes you panic a little thinking it could be another stroke.

Some improvements and questions from my side:

* I can walk ‚Äònormally‚Äô. Though I struggle from the inside constantly thinking that I might tumble.
* I am able to write now (I'm left-handed), though slowly.
* Speaking of slow, my annoyance stems from the fact that everything I do on my left side is slower now. There‚Äôs improvement, but I just wish it was back to what it was before.¬†

I am of course happy and thankful to have survived and I still have a long way for recovery. I just miss being independent ‚Äì and that‚Äôs the thing that I hate that this stroke has taken away.

We called an ambulance over to our house to get him help. The paramedics arrived and determined that he had a stroke, and they took him to the ER. My mom and one of my older sisters went to the hospital to be there for him, while myself and my other older sister stayed home to keep an eye on the house. My sister that went to be there for dad with mom would send us updates on his condition via texting.

It's been an emotional rollercoaster for all of us, and I've never been anymore scared for dad, that I actually bawled like a baby. The stroke caused a large blood clot in the left side of his brain that there's nothing they could do about, and my mom tearfully refused to sign the DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) form. This morning, as of writing, we're going to see him, perhaps for the final time. I'll edit this opening post when I get home from the visit to keep you updated.

Some emotional support from this community would be most appreciated. Thank you.

Sombering Update (12:26 PM PDT): Turns out, the stroke was catastrophic, and along with his other medical problems and old age, he might not have much longer to live. If he's still alive by tomorrow, we could visit him again.

Even more Sombering Update (4/10/24 6:10 PM PDT): My mom signed the DNR form for dad. Along with that dad is suffering from arrhythmia in the ICU, so it's unlikely that he'll survive the night, and I am really grieving right now because of it.

Update (4/11/24 6:25 AM PDT): My dad is still hanging on at this point, as it turns out at the moment, still hasn't died yet, despite the arrhythmia yesterday.

I was on the ICU floor where I used to work, I had many patients in the very room where I was then a patient. The doctors took such good care of me, they remembered me.  It was so strange as I had no idea what had happened, I was aphasic and paralyzed.  Everyone talked over me, not to me.  I never did that to my patients when I was a nurse, even non responsive patients. I had so much pain in my head I thought I had gotten shot.  

The doctors and nurses discussed my living will and my possible discharge to Hospice, all at the bedside where I could hear then but not reply.   I started using my meditation techniques that I've practiced daily for years, who knew they would have come into play saving my life.   As I began to speak I learned I had 2 strokes.  I meditated in the hospital bed 12 hours a day reconnecting the near pathways and dismantling the clot in my brain.  

I've had great recovery.  I wrote a lengthy and descriptive letter to the physicians, the nursing supervisor and my physicians about my care at the hospital, which was in general very good, but so many missed opportunities they could have provided comfort with little effort on their part, when I was paralyzed and mute.

Her left side appears to be paralyzed from the neck down, at least for now, but the doctors have said she will almost certainly be partially paralyzed forever.

My dad died from cancer just 10 months ago and I took on a lot of his care before he did, largely because I wanted to and also to support my mom. Never in a million years did I think my mom would be needing full-time, intensive care less than a year after his death. 

I'm finishing my degree that I had started shortly before my dad passed, and I was so close to being done - I've had to interrupt now for obvious reasons. I've moved countries back home to care for my mom, pausing my degree, giving up my flat that I shared with my partner (24m), turning down job opportunities I applied for in the country I did my degree in, and likely giving up my right to live and work in said country in the future by violating the conditions for extending my residency permit. All of these decisions were made basically overnight with the view that I would become my mom's primary carer for the foreseeable future - now I'm starting to freak out about the full weight of this responsibility and what it means for my life.

I am obviously blessed that my degree has the flexibility for me to interrupt, my partner has even offered (and I accepted) to move countries to support me, and I will likely qualify for a carers allowance that would cover daily expenses. I've even been a carer before - but with my dad it was terminal, so as terrible as it sounds it was never going to be long term and I was just greatful for every moment I got to spend with him. I know I should just be greatful my mom is alive, and I am, but hopefully she still lives a very long life and that could mean she is my responsibility for the next 20+ years.

Can I start a family while looking after a disabled parent? Is my relationship going to survive moving in with my mom in a foreign country? Am I going to regret giving up the life in the country I had started to see as ""home"", where all of my friends and social network live?

I do have other siblings but one (29m) lives even further abroad and the other (32m) is already struggling with his mental health.

When I thought it was a stroke, I asked him to smile, had him raise his arms, checked his eyes, asked him to keep speaking to me, etc. When he didn‚Äôt present any other symptoms, I chalked it up to a pinched nerve because he was messing around in the hotel gym the night before.

Once the stroke was diagnosed, he just mentally collapsed. It was like a bubble burst. Luckily the only symptoms he still suffers from are some mild motor skill issues. He can talk, walk, drive, and participate in his hobbies. 

Seeing the MRI at the neurologist today, she said that he‚Äôd had multiple strokes over those couple of days. I can‚Äôt get over the fact that I should have known better.

n670hr,stroke,1620306918.0,"**D is for depression.**

Almost [30% of stroke survivors develop post-stroke depression](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000113#:~:text=Depression%20is%20common%20after%20stroke,a%20cumulative%20incidence%20of%2055%25.). For some reason, this is still a relatively new area of study. The American Heart Association published its first scientific statement on post-stroke depression in 2016.

So much of recovery and rehabilitation is focused on the physical, but we‚Äôre not just physical beings.

We are so much more. We are spiritual, emotional, intellectual, and social beings. Focusing too narrowly on the physical aspect of recovery is not enough.

Unfortunately, this often comes down to the survivor to advocate for their own mental health needs. The systems in place, at least in the U.S., still tend to focus on the physical.

So what can you do about it?

**Express yourself.** Let people know (whether it‚Äôs your rehab team, your doctor, your family, your friends) that you are feeling down. People can‚Äôt help you unless they know that you‚Äôre struggling. It‚Äôs not easy to do, especially if you‚Äôre the type of person that doesn‚Äôt like asking for help.

**Reach out.** Ask for help from family or friends, or get booked with a counselor. Don‚Äôt forget that, having survived a stroke, you have also survived trauma. You may go through a [grieving process](https://elysenewland.com/articles/grief-and-acceptance) for your old self, and depression plays an active role in that.

**Understand.** There is absolutely nothing wrong with you for feeling down. In fact, with up to 30% of all stroke survivors experiencing depression, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs unfortunately common. You are not alone.

**What is it?**

In short, the muscles closest to your body have to be strong and stable before you can regain mobility of the muscles farther away from your body.

To achieve movement in the hand, you have to make sure that your shoulders are strong. While you focus on the movement and strength of the hand, don‚Äôt forget to strengthen your shoulders! 

An easy way to do this is by shrugging your shoulders up to your ears and then pressing them down towards the ground. It‚Äôs an easy and effective exercise you can do anywhere!

He was in ICU for 20 days, he didn‚Äôt went through a surgery because he was hospitalized in hour-5,  which allowed doctors to give him medicine to let the bleeding leak out by itself. Doctors told me that the bleeding might continue to spill into his midbrain and he might be in vegetative state forever, all they could do is to stabilize his blood pressure ( 260/100) and wait.

After 20 days he woke up with zero strength on the right side, aphasia, apraxia and zero sense of self. All he do is staring into thin air, no talking and also no emotions. He could understand basic commands such as raise your hand up, he doesn‚Äôt talk at all while doing so, and he also sleep a lot. This continue on for the next 30 days, he couldn‚Äôt call when it comes to personal hygiene. During this time he got PT while lying on beds.
After that he got moved to neurology department where he got medicines injection to help aid Alzheimer and Dementia. During this time he gradually improve on his ability to get up from bed and regain his back muscle.
Fast forward today, after everyday of reminding him of his past and showing him care and love, he finally said to me, i remember you now, you are my son, it brought us both to tears. He continue on trying to communicate with some words loss here and there, gibberish and also some confusion but man, I finally sense the old self of my dad back, the guy who loves his family and never rely on anybody and never tell you he loves you.
I‚Äôm in tears writing this down, after 3 months he finally remember me, he can also sit up from bed and stand tall , is this recovery considered fast after 3 months?
I want to give some hope for fellow caregivers here. I talk it all out when i‚Äôm with him, from daily struggles to stress caused by his situation. He seems very understanding today, but he told me no need to worry, he will fight back and come back stronger.

The following Saturday after Easter Holiday last month, my SO (50/male)and I were out running errands and our first stop that day was to Family Dollar. We just started our shopping and we were going down the 2nd aisle in the store. We weren't even there 10 minutes when everything changed.

Heres what happened to me

It felt like something popped in my head.
Everything around me went black.
After a few seconds, my vision came back, but not the normal way.
Everything looked a bit brighter.
I couldn't look straightforward. My eyes kept looking to the right.
My hearing on my right side intensified.
Then It turned into a constant ringing.
I tried to take a step forward and I couldn't.
My legs felt like jello
I started slurring my words then drilling.
I knew what I was trying to say but I would say something completely different.
I knew right away that I had a stroke.
I told my SO that I needed to go to the ER
He thought I was faking everything because he thought I just wanted to go home.
He kept telling me that I was making a scene and to stop embarrassing him.
He thought I had low blood sugar and brought me home
As soon as I got home I fell asleep and didn‚Äôt wake up until the following Monday
When he got home from work he finally took me to the RR
That is when he finally believed that my suspicions were correct
Because he didn‚Äôt believe me and waited for days to bring me to the ER my Stroke condition is worse than what it should have been and I blame him
I also blacked out when he dragged me back to the car from the store otherwise I would‚Äôve called emergency myself if I had my mind right and not blacked out and slept for days.

It went really well. Our bed is too high so getting her up there to change her was difficult (I have a lift, but I need to lower the bed).  We got it done though, and before getting her back in her chair was able to lay side by side for the first time in 11 months.

I was tired of course and fearful they wouldn't pick her up on time, but they did. Then of course I cried when we loaded her back into the van.

hi ‚ô° im female (20) i had my 2 relatively small strokes in june... ive made a few posts here before.

i say my strokes were small due to the fact that they resolved on their own within a minute. i was basically paralyzed on my entire right side for a few moments before it resolved itself. couldnt move my right arm or the right side of my face. it wasnt a TIA though, it was documented as a lacunar infarction on my left brain & it was relatively small, they said.

but the reason im asking this question to people is because this has been a strange journey of recovery for me & im wondering if there is anyone that can relate to me. 

after a couple of weeks when we figured out the cause of my stroke (i had a grade 3 pfo that got closed up after they found it) i felt perfectly normal again.

but now as time goes on ive noticed that there are things wrong with me.

i get dizzy easier, i feel more brain fog, muscle aching/spasming/tightness in both sides, pins & needles in fingers occasionally, feeling like my arms arent there, etc. things that i didnt notice in the beginning so much, really.

and no doctors are giving any insight on this. im confused because i thought my stroke was so minimal. i dont understand how it could be affecting me this much. i know that ANY stroke is a big deal because of how delicate the brain is, but i just thought since it resolved on its own it wouldnt be such a big deal. 

they said my brain suffered ischemic stroke in a couple of tiny places on the left side (all in relatively the same area), so i guess it makes sense that its not just a one & done issue...

but i dunno. even my neurologist didnt really say anything. he just kept saying 'okay' when i told him this stuff, & he didnt say if it was normal or not. it seems like no one cares & its making me very emotional. 

im just really looking for some advice from people who relate to how ive felt. even if u just share some of your story, it could help my conscience a lot ‚ô°

15ov8wt,stroke,1691816235.0,"Hi All,

I'm a 38 year old male who had a Cerebral Stroke mid October last year. I suffered on my left side the most. Did Rehab in Late November/ Early December.

Had to wait until there was an opening. I am an Aged Care Worker. Been working in Aged Care as a Carer since 2017. I survived the stroke.

When I spoke to the rehab team Leader I told her I needed the works. My left side was affected. Speech was slightly affected as well as left leg and hand.

I was initially walking with a walking stick as my balance was greatly affected. I was determined to lose the walking stick as I was embarrassed by it.

The Physio Therapist helped me to achieve that goal. Walking normally was the first thing to come back after 8 weeks. I told them that I needed extensive Occupational Therapy on my left hand.

I only got 4 sessions of OT. They didn't listen to me at all. I told them initially that I needed speech therapy. I had to fight for that to happen and it didn't happen until February of this year.

I've lost the fine motor skills on my left hand and it's really getting to me. I Live alone and doing simple tasks is tough. My hand still shakes periodically.

Small tasks like shaving the left side of my face are impossible as my left hand is unable to do so. I've been relying on my right hand for everything.

It's safe to say I'm tired. I know it might be something small but losing the fine motor skills on my left hand is tough. I never realised how much it did as it's my non dominant hand.

I start work with a new organisation next week and it's safe to say that I'm scared. I've informed my new employer about the stroke and they are supportive.

I want to go back to how I was before the stroke when everything worked. I truly wish that the stroke had killed me. The past 10 months have been rough.

Physically, emotionally and financially fucked. It's safe to say I'm tired and want it to end. I've spoken with Psychologist's but it doesn't help.

I can't get past losing the fine motor skills on my left hand. Any advice on how I can fix it or what to do?

10qfo2q,stroke,1675212032.0,"Today I visited my father at the stroke rehab where he arrived yesterday. He was in the regular hospital for just over a week following his stroke on 1/21. 

It was my first time seeing my father (65) in person in 6 years. We have a good relationship now that I am an adult, but I didn‚Äôt grow up with him in the picture and I live on the other side of the country, so it‚Äôs often a few years in between visits at the best of times. And the Covid era has not been the best of times. 

I was scared to see him, if I am honest. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. No one close to me has had a stroke before, and even from what little I know (mainly thanks to the members of this sub), the effects
vary greatly by type of stroke and by individual. 

When I arrived today, I was pleasantly surprised to find that his personality is intact. He is very bright and a big talker, and that was on full display today, to my great relief. In fact, immediately prior to his stroke he was experiencing a bout of worsened depression, and his affect today is considerably brighter than what it was at that time. 

He has a long road ahead, with hemiparesis on his right (dominant) side from shoulder down. But he can bend his right knee now, and for the first time today, was able to slightly move a few of his fingers. He seems very intent on his physical recovery. Written on his hospital whiteboard: ‚ÄúI want to walk out of here.‚Äù 

I brought him a few things today,
including a pad of nice mixed media art paper, markers, etc. He is a lifelong visual artist and I think he will enjoy the challenge of drawing with his non-dominant hand, while he waits to find out whether his right hand will come back to the party. I rigged up the sketch pad with a handle for one-handed lifting and a silicone backing so it does not slide during one-handed use. I also brought him some shoes for PT that I chose with the help of this sub, with elastic laces per your kind and helpful recommendations. 

He is back to reading too. Someone brought him his copy of Moby Dick today and he had it by his side all during our visit. I stayed for two hours; after his first full day of therapies (speech, OT, PT), he was pretty tired by the end of the 2nd hour. A longtime friend of his showed up unexpectedly toward the end and he sent us off to have coffee together, which was great.

I feel that I can rest easier tonight than I have since 1/21, and fully look forward to our visit tomorrow, knowing that he is still himself, and seemingly more grateful for his life than ever. 

I am sure his recovery will not be all sunshine and daisies. No one‚Äôs is, and no part of his life has been. But I am grateful that he is here, and that I and many others are able to be supportive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/10qfo2q/visited_father_in_stroke_rehab_today/,Visited father in stroke rehab today.,,19,8,1.0

My stroke was on the left side of my brain stem and I lost my right side. Luckily after a couple months of physical and occupational therapy, I was able to get back most of my body control. The right side of my face and head will always be numb now (but the muscles work), as is my right eye which gets scratched more often since I can‚Äôt feel it and my tear ducts don‚Äôt work properly anymore, and my leg feels different even though I have full control.

That said, the worst things I still deal with are fatigue and mental health issues. I feel like nothing makes me happy.. I‚Äôm just kind of numb to everything.. I still play my part as a dad and husband, and I know that there are survivors that aren‚Äôt as lucky as I am as far as recovery, and I try to ‚Äúbe happier‚Äù but there‚Äôs nothing there.. 

I explain it to family and friends as I feel like I‚Äôve ‚Äúlost my mojo‚Äù and am just kind of floating through life now. Nothing that used to bring me joy does it anymore.. I also have 0 drive to go out or do anything social. 

I know this all screams depression and I have been on anti depressants for most of my life. My original medication (Prozac, that I used for almost 20 years) stopped working after my stroke. It was overwhelmingly rough dealing with the anxiety and depression without a functioning medication. They switched me to lexapro and Wellbutrin, but they don‚Äôt work as well and I‚Äôve just kind of decided to deal with it.. 

It‚Äôs also tough because I look/present as normal. No one would know I had a stroke by looking at me. I‚Äôm not disabled, but I‚Äôm not fully abled honestly. It‚Äôs hard to navigate relationships, work, and well.. life.

She was in the hospital for about 1 week. The first 5 ish days then told us she might not make it and that if she did she would likely never walk again and possible never speak again. 

The clot was in the left hand side of her brain and she is paralyzed on the right down in her arm and leg. 

Now she has been moved to a rehab and she is already making improvements over the last two weeks. She can speak saying words like yes and no, she has said some peoples names and today she said the sun is shining.

A week before the stroke she broke her arm and was actually supposed to have surgery on it the day of the stroke. Obviously they haven‚Äôt done that yet so the arm she ‚Äú can use‚Äù is actually broken and she is in morphine for pain. 

The morphine seems to be making her extremely tired and they have said they were having trouble waking her so the speech therapist couldn‚Äôt work with her yesterday. 

It‚Äôs so frustrating that the whole situation seems to boil down to it and she if she improves. If she doesn‚Äôt make improvements they say they will have to discharge her from the rehab and send her home.

vdq3vw,stroke,1655397432.0,"My (f-53) dad (77) had a series of strokes Memorial weekend, and has been in the hospital since. Last week, we were sure it was going to be the big goodbye because he wasn't fully waking up, and because of his advance directives (DNR, no artificial nutrition), there really wasn't much more to do.

He has since woken up, but he's just not really there anymore. He can eat, but often chooses not to, or tells the nurse that he already ate and says he's not hungry. He keeps pulling out the IVs, so he's not getting the fluids he needs (doctor thinks restraining him will do more harm than good, and he keeps pulling off the mitts they put on him). He knows who we are, but often forgets we're even in the room. He often cries every time we see him that he just wants to go home, and I'm not sure ""home"" is necessarily a physical place, just a place where he can be the healthy, active guy he used to be. At the rate things are going, he's either going to have another stoke, a heart attack or go into kidney failure.

For background, he's been a diabetic (mostly well managed) for almost 30 years, had his pituitary gland removed (benign growth) about 40 years ago, has high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He was on statin drugs for a while, but they did a number on his leg muscles, and severely depreciated his quality of life. Now the strokes. Even before the stroke, he was getting angry and combative with mom about little things she would try to do for him. He hadn't been able to drive much because of cataracts (was going to get them addressed in July), so he'd basically been stuck in the house. He was done with his failing body before this and now...

The doctor has told us his long term prognosis is ""poor"" and we accept that. They're talking about a skilled nursing facility that could provide rehab while it's helpful, and hospice when it comes to that. The one thing mom (73) and I are adamant about is that he cannot come home. It would be totally unfair for mom to have to care for him in this state. She's already exhausted and bringing him home would be detrimental to her physical and mental health, even with home health aides. To top off, she doesn't drive, so she would be trapped there with him with little opportunity for a break. I'm of only some help because I live 60 miles away, am our household's primary breadwinner and my husband is out of work on workman's comp awaiting surgery for a hip issue (if the WC insurance would get off their \*\*\*\* as approve the referral). My work has been beyond supportive and have let me be there as often as I need to be, but there's still work to get done and we've short staffed. Sad thing is work is where I go to relax these days. Those problems I can do something about.

Mom and I went to visit him yesterday and only got in about 30 minutes of being there before he got confused, angry and combative. He basically told us to leave him alone and get lost, so we did. Over lunch and beers we joked that there's a plane leaving for Puerta Vallarta this evening and we could be on it.

Long term thinking and planning is likely a matter of weeks, not months, but each day brings something different. Monday it was palliative care because he was regressing; Tuesday he was eating some, chatty and sleeping, so back to the skilled nursing plan.  Yesterday, he was just confused, mean and disruptive to the poor nursing staff. I'm not sure how much rehab he'll actually be able to do because he gets angry when the hospital PTs try to work with him. If the pendulum would just stop swinging, we could make plans for recovery, or for final arrangements. So, for now, we wait. The skilled nursing facilities in their city are not accepting new patients because of COVID outbreaks. They may send him to one in my city for a while, but that would mean mom wouldn't be able to see him much and I would take over more of the visiting and coordinating.  That would be hard for her, but maybe better for her mental health, at least for a while. At least I wouldn't have to drive 120 miles round trip as often.

I miss my dad and he's not even gone. I'm annoyed that if this damn stroke and his other health issues are going to take him, why can't they just get on with it, and guilty that I even think that. Sad thing is that mom is on the same emotional rollercoaster. It would destroy dad to know that his and mom's hard earned retirement funds may have to be used to keep him in a life he doesn't want to live, but home just isn't an option (mom's or mine). We feel selfish and guilty about thinking his passing would just be better for everyone, especially mom so she could just get on with her life. I hate seeing him like this, but hate seeing her like this even more.

I‚Äôm a professional athlete so I‚Äôd consider myself fairly healthy, and I‚Äôve never had any previous heart issues besides low blood pressure. Since January I‚Äôve been dealing with strange migraines that would happen every to every other day and would cause confusion and disassociation type symptoms that I couldn‚Äôt control. I would get lost walking home, forget how to write, forget how to tie my shoes, would be unable to recognize my surroundings or the people in them no matter how familiar they actually were. My doctor called these confusional migraines, I tried some medicine and moved on. 
     Then last week I experienced what I thought was just a really fast developing and intense migraine. I lost vision on my right side and it was replaced with static, I had very intense 9/10 pain on the right side of my head, and my left arm went numb and was pretty difficult to move. Knowing what I know now I definitely should‚Äôve gone to the hospital and I‚Äôm very lucky that the situation didn‚Äôt go any worse than it did. I got an mri and an mra as soon as possible, and it showed that I do in fact have damage that would indicate a stroke like event with no known cause. The first few days afterwards I had less feeling in both my arm and leg on my left side and had a harder time moving them along with pretty intense head pain on the right side and a lot of fatigue. Now the only difference that‚Äôs still sticking around is the head pain. It feels like I hit my head really hard I guess. My doctor wants to test my heart to see if there‚Äôs a hole since I think that could be one reason I had this mini stroke. 
   To those that have dealt with this before or have known others who have, how do you get over being scared that it will happen again? The doctors visits and all the tests are definitely a bit overwhelming and scary, but I‚Äôm most scared about it happening again.

Because all the doctors thought it was a stroke that was involved somehow with potential Parkinson‚Äôs‚Ä¶ (which he was not diagnosed with yet but we‚Äôre looking into before this) there was no urgency to get a follow-up MRI. They all knew he needed it but it was not pressured and he has developed extreme claustrophobia (maybe also the tumor or early Parkinson or other trauma). 

Now, my dad has months, maybe. He is recovering from risky brain surgery for tumor that kills. We‚Äôre taking his recovery and the time he has left with us hour by hour.

prbthh,stroke,1632070827.0,"Wife had hemorrhagic Stroke in July this year. It was three days after having her left above knee amputation. To start, she was not responsive on her right side of her body. Had feeding tube. 

I had to really pay attention to how treatment was going forward. After she was out of ICU and a week in a regular hospital room they transferred her to an acute care specialty hospital / long term nursing. 

Right away I observed the staff at this place not doing any neurological testing I observed at the hospital were she was at. None of the nurses preformed and testing in the three days she was there. I was at her bedside 12 hours a day and I did the neurological response I observed the nurses do at the hospital were she had been. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure why it was different at this other place but I also observed they would not put her bed back at the 30 degrees angle she was supposed to be at with the feeding tube. Every time they had to move her (2 hours and bedding changes) they left her at about 10degrees. I would correct that at lifts her back to 30. 

On day three she was becoming less responsive to my testing and was told she was just very sleepy and exhausted. On that third day she was so abnormal in response I insisted the nurses check her. They finally realized she was having problems and a doctor got her in for a CT scan. 

She had edema putting pressure back on her brain and they didn‚Äôt have the ability to treat that so back the the original hospital she went. I insisted back at the hospital she not return to that place. As a result the hospital treated her edema at she returned to being responsive quickly. 

I realized I needed to be absolutely involved in any decision being made going forward. I had to question and understand everything they were doing and wanted to do. Especially with medication. By this time my wife was improving where she could talk and swallow. She could communicate that she had pain but unable to say exactly what it was. I had to be active in understanding her so the staff at the hospital could treat her correctly. 

Long story short, I was able to get her off the feeding tube and get them to stop giving her narcotics. She was then qualified to go to inpatient rehabilitation there at that hospital. She was there for 4 weeks and although her right side was still non functional she has started to regain feeling and some movement with her arm and leg. 

She needs my care 24/7 at home with movement and all other needs. She needs a wheelchair and I work with her twice a day with rehab exercises and medications. This week will be setting up in home PT / OT / Speech therapy. 

One major challenge is going to be getting her into and out of our car to be able to get to outpatient therapy. I can‚Äôt afford wheelchair transportation as insurance doesn‚Äôt cover that.

o6k4u3,stroke,1624476758.0,"My mom had a massive MCA left stroke which seems to have affected her right side. She‚Äôs also not been able to talk to us. 

After her stroke which happened on a Saturday night at a party. Everyone there seemed to have assumed she was drunk, which was odd because she doesn‚Äôt drink. It didn‚Äôt click for a while to everyone there that she was really bad. And her being out in the country, outside of the city and 30 minutes from the nearest hospital didn‚Äôt make things easy. 

I live out of state from her so when I got the phone call from my sister and it was a ‚Äúmom got really drunk at a party and she‚Äôs in an ambulance headed to the hospital‚Äù. I was pretty upset because my little brother is with her and she needs to be coherent. She was expected to drive him home after too. So i didn‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôd get drunk. 

I went to sleep that night and just told my sister there to get in touch if anything else changes. 

I woke up early that morning because I got a weird feeling. And I had a bunch of phone calls and texts and one of them was a ‚Äúdude it‚Äôs serious, mom had a massive stroke‚Äù. I immediately called my sister and we both broke down. The kind of stroke she had was really bad. My sister said when she went to meet them at the hospital before they transferred her out to a bigger hospital in the state capital that she wouldn‚Äôt move anymore and just shake. She looked frozen. They told us that they‚Äôd do everything to save her but it was bad. She was too far out of the city and they didn‚Äôt know it was a stroke first. 

I don‚Äôt blame anyone for how they responded. I don‚Äôt think anyone would of known it was a stroke. It broke my heart. My sister and family has been particularly mean to her. They would tell her things and make her cry before hand. My sister would tell her she‚Äôd beat her if it wasn‚Äôt for her kids being around. My mom was set to move out that following week in 3 days. She had signed her lease for her new apartment. She was so excited. She had visited people and talked to them over the phone telling them she was getting her new place and getting out of the abuse‚Ä¶ and now her whole life has changed. 

My family and sister regrets everything. Everyone has changed their minds and things. My dad had my mom blocked for being annoying since they separated. She would constantly be obsessing over him. 

The day she had the stroke my little brother got her phone and texted my dad right away since he lived a few blocks away from the party. And he ignored all of the texts. He didn‚Äôt want anything to do with them. He regrets it now and I tell him not to blame himself. But had he read them he‚Äôd know it‚Äôs my little brother and not my mom messaging him asking for help. He was terrified watching my mom look like she‚Äôs never had. He even messaged me and that‚Äôs how I got confused. He was talking to me asking how I would react when I was too drunk. And trying to give himself reassurance. He got to see her before they sent her out to the other hospital and he was just bawling according to my sister because his own mom couldn‚Äôt talk back to him or look at him. 

I wanted to head out but everyone said things would be fine. Extended family was informed and everyone wanted to go see but with Covid protocols only two people are allowed. Unless she was about to pass we‚Äôd all be let in. 

About 2-3 days in. The swelling was to start. And it did. But given her stroke. Everything they anticipated was worse. She had a heart issue which they still haven‚Äôt been able to figure out. She‚Äôs apparently diabetic and has high blood pressure. Things she‚Äôs gotten checked before and nothing. She didn‚Äôt know. And neither did we. But her brain swelled more than anyone would of thought that she went into a coma. She was dying and that‚Äôs when I got a call telling me they were doing emergency surgery but they don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs going to make it. She was on a ventilator. Everyone told me to wait and now they told me I had hours. Just hours when I lived in a totally different state. Granted it‚Äôs not far by plane. 2 hours a bit over. Or drive about 20 hours. What was I supposed to do? The plane tickets were over $400 and I only had $200 in my bank. I could only get one the next day. Everything was crumbling. I wanted her to hear me and feel me next to her. We‚Äôve been closer than my other siblings. I‚Äôm her oldest. I thought maybe she‚Äôd want to see me and know I was there with her. 

I made it the day after and they had to cut her skull to make room for her brain to swell up. They weren‚Äôt sure if it would work but it did. When I got there the next day I went from the airport to the hospital. I got made the primary decision maker for her. And she had no hair on her but she was off the ventilator. And on her own. She saw me and somewhat smiled. She gripped my hand with her left working hand. I laid my head down on her lap and she touched my head and scratched my back like she would when I was a child and sick. My mommy was there. 

Months before all this happened she complained of feeling weak and tired. Tingly/numb right arms. I told her she was having stroke like symptoms. To get checked and she did. She went to an ER months back for it because it got worse. They dismissed her claims and told her to go home. No one bothered to care. English isn‚Äôt her first language but I know she explained just like I told her to. And they disregarded her. 

The current place she‚Äôs at which is the same hospital group with the one from our hometown said she had to have had smaller strokes. And this could of been less massive than it was. She won‚Äôt ever have her quality of life back. They told us the part of her brain that seems to have died inside is her speech part. So she will mostlikely never talk again. She still has blood clots inside her brain they cant remove. I‚Äôm wondering if these smaller strokes were the ones that changed her personality a bit. I‚Äôm still working on taking all of this. I am taking FMLA leave from work. I am set to start university back home too. And I‚Äôm working on getting all her documents sorted now. This is all so tough. This is my little rant here.

Mental practice, also known as motor imagery, has been used by athletes and musicians for years to sharpen their skills.

Essentially, mental practice is the act of imagining yourself doing an activity or exercise without any actual movement. It's been found to cause cortical reorganization (brain changes and adaptation) and improve arm use after stroke.

Every relationship has its issues, and something I really liked about my relationship is that we always seemed to work through any problems in a healthy manner. 

Things have changed since the stroke. We have been living together and since the stroke I feel like I'm holding her back and it's caused alot of tension our relationship and our life.

I was lucky enough to keep my normal functions, but I still do not think it's fair of me to let her take care of me (Im not allowed to drive, I've had to go back to the hospital due to signs of a TIA). 

Three weeks after the stroke, her mom was trying to convince her to break up with me, and that caused a ripple between her parents and I.

Her mom threatened to disown her if she didn't break up with me and move back in with them. 

Before the stroke, we would hang out with her parents alot (her mom is like her best friend). But after the stroke (and the whole disowned thing) that has changed. 

I can tell that she really misses having conversations with her mom. On Friday her mom invited her over for dinner, and every day this weekend she has been back over to her moms place to hang out. 

I just don't feel welcome at her parents place anymore, and they haven't invited me, so I ask her to go without me.

I know she loves hanging out with her mom, and I don't want to be the reason that stops. But I don't feel comfortable staying alone by myself at the house. 

She has suffered alot since the stroke, but at times, its hard for me to see past my own suffering. I dont want to stop her from seeing her family. But at the same time I want to feel safe.

bluu4e,stroke,1557256475.0,"I was thirty days from retirement, enjoying a weekend away at our cabin retreat, the place I called home, comfortable in knowing all was right with the world. Then the phone rang. As it was a Sunday, it was a little odd to get a call at 7:00 a.m. but happened sometimes. When my husband answered, I heard long pauses and tones of concern. Thinking something had happened to my father who was 84, I listened attentively. However, when he used the pronoun ""she"", the alarms went off. Something had happened to one of my babies. By the end of the call, I knew it was Kari, my 33-year-old daughter and mother of two girls. I also knew it was critical because my eavesdropping only deciphered more unknowns; it was life-threatening, occurred suddenly, undefined, unidentified. Kari was in the ICU without the ability to talk or move her right side - without her mother.

Randy and I dressed, piled in the car without bothering to pack anything except our phones. We scooped up our dog, Dagny, determined to find a place to drop her off. We drove down the mountain road as we had done so many times before. Only this time we soared around curves and bends, memorized from extensive navigation the past 25 years. Dagny was handed off to Uncle Ron as his house resided between the cabin and the hospital.

Anybody who has visited a patient in ICU knows it is a traumatic experience to see a loved one hooked up to tubes from numerous body points, feeding into one unit that acts as a brain for what occurs in the body. Having lived this nightmare before with different characters, terror stabbed my heart - not surprise. With my daughter as the protagonist, my breathing became shallow, my heart pounded violently, and my brain seized on worst case scenarios. My bodily functions didn‚Äôt return to normal until many days later, but the stress tapered when my baby looked at us with recognition and smiled. She was in ICU five days, and in the hospital a total of 11 days.

Following doctor‚Äôs recommendations, Kari moved into St. Luke‚Äôs Rehabilitation Hospital for an additional thirty-two days, bringing the total number of days institutionalized to forty-three. During that time, her husband, Dan, and I defiantly sat by her side even though she probably would have appreciated some privacy. Our mission to protect her was unnamed but clear.

Now, six months after the stroke, Kari continues making gains in therapy. Each day reminds us this is a marathon with short-term successes and hurdles. Though obstacles sometimes slow her journey to recovery, no barriers stop her progression. Her actions exhibit determination. Kari doesn‚Äôt talk in terms of what she can accomplish, will achieve, or desires to complete; she simply lives life.

So I had my hemorrhagic stroke coming up on 2 years ago at the end of July. Since that time, I've had a lot of devastation in my life, including my wife divorcing me, losing a number of friends, getting sober (which probably would've eventually killed me), and countless other things. But the one thing that hasn't happened is a good cry.

Before my stroke, I was in therapy and would cry regularly. Not a lot, but a healthy amount for a man my age (43). But the spigot has been turned off apparently. I think it would be so cathartic to cry right now, but I just can't. Even when I think about the devastating things that have happened to me, no tears come or my eyes just well up briefly.

Any advice?

1dhc6tp,stroke,1718557754.0,"Hi all. Super long post coming. I‚Äôve followed this thread a while and it‚Äôs helped tremendously to read similar stories to mine. Thank you all so much for sharing your experiences. 

I had an ischemic lacunar stroke in April 2022 (age 42). It seems to have been caused by a combination of high blood pressure and high cholesterol left untreated far too long.

I woke up in the middle of the night unable to feel or move my right side from basically the neck down, but I was super lucky to wake up and call an ambulance to get to the hospital in time for the tPA. It‚Äôs been a long, hard road but I‚Äôve regained most of my strength and mobility in my right side, aside from a few minor things like reduced finger/hand dexterity (right hand) and minor lack of foot control.

I‚Äôm still making improvements to this day which amazes me. I‚Äôm just now getting to the point where walking feels almost totally ‚Äúnormal‚Äù/smooth/correct‚Ä¶if that makes sense. I did PT (physical therapy) for 6 months via insurance but then have had to supplement out of pocket with yoga and a personal trainer at my gym who‚Äôs expensive but has been a miracle in my life.  Overall, I feel super lucky to be where I‚Äôm at. 

Anyway, the main issue I still struggle with is the fatigue. Most days as I go along and complete tasks (home and work) and physical activities (dog walks/workouts) I begin to feel nerve pain in my right jaw and base of the neck and a numbness in my arm/hand (I think associated with the same nerve bundle to my neck/jaw), and then eventually it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm weighed down or gravity is heavier just on my right side (head also feels heavy) and of course I feel mentally tired and sleepy. I then just sort of have to lay down and maybe nap. Some days it‚Äôs not so bad and some days it‚Äôs pretty bad. I don‚Äôt typically nap during the day as much as I was the first year or so, but still sometimes I‚Äôm in bed at 8pm. 

I‚Äôve basically just had to give up on having much of a social life. What‚Äôs super annoying though is my friends and associates don‚Äôt seem to believe me when I tell them I‚Äôm still struggling with fatigue. They‚Äôll almost always respond with something like‚Ä¶‚ÄùOh we‚Äôre just getting old. I‚Äôm tired a lot too.‚Äù, or ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs just a side effect of medications.‚Äù, or some other such thing. Why don‚Äôt they take my word for it that it‚Äôs bc I had a f‚Äôing stroke? It‚Äôs the same with my boss. I came back to work probably too soon (only after 2 months of leave) but asked for a reduced workload (we‚Äôre paid via commissions 100%) but he just keeps piling on no matter how many times I plead for less work.

This post is mostly just for sharing and venting but it‚Äôs to the point where I want to quit my job and move away to a secluded mountain cabin with my dog.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. All the very best to everyone in your recovery. Keep moving every day but prioritize rest/sleep. Remember how amazing the brain is.

1bsn0ip,stroke,1711924324.0,"I suffered an acute ischemic stroke on November 20th of last year that left me paralyzed on the left side.  The more that I started to recover, the worse the spasticity became. It was especially triggered by anything resembling a resting position, causing my shoulder, arm, hand, leg, foot, and big toe to tense up without anyway to easily release it.  It‚Äôs still an issue throughout the day, whenever sitting.  

Recently my shoulder has subluxated which can be really painful.  I‚Äôve tried ordering different types of splints, slings, and braces.  None in particular help except the hand wrist splint which I wear only when sleeping.  I did notice that certain stretches can help release the spasticity.  The best has been stretching my calve using a foam ramp under my foot.  That helps a lot.  I wanted to share that and I‚Äôd like to better understand what other things can help like that.

Lately I‚Äôve been trying to find an equivalent I can use in bed while I sleep.  Before my stroke I was watching shark tank where sleep hug did a pitch for their sleeping pod, which gently hugs your body while you sleep, their idea came from the swaddling technique used to calm upset babies.  It‚Äôs really hard to see the pitch without wanting one so I got one back during the kickstarter. 

I was a big fan of it until my stroke, at which point things were hard enough already to then add trying to get in and then it of a bag every night.  I totally forgot about it until just recently.  Now I‚Äôm recovered enough to walk short distances without a cane or anything, my arm and shoulders have a ways to go still though.  I was really curious if the gentle pressure would help me relax and fall asleep and hopefully not wake up to some terrible pain because my muscles spasmed during my sleep.

It actually helped me fall asleep easier and stay asleep and when I wake up there‚Äôs very little pain if any at all.  I look absolutely ridiculous in it but my partner seems to enjoy that.  I wanted to share that in hopes it can help someone else.  I hesitate to include a link to it because I don‚Äôt particularly care where you buy it and that‚Äôs not the point of this post at all.

1bs0u7k,stroke,1711856260.0,"in case anyone cares, i‚Äôll start with the basics: i had a stroke at the end of may last year at the age of 38. i was in two different hospitals for about two months. i don‚Äôt remember any of the month of june and bits and pieces of july then august. one of those months (basically all of july) i was at a hospital for inpatient rehab, seeing things that weren‚Äôt really there, falling, peeing in old bottles (if not something worse), basically just laying in bed until eventually i was passable enough to go home. which i did after two months at the end of july. i saw a few pictures from a few days after my incident and good lord i literally looked like death. 

some pros: 
i can walk relatively well. i‚Äôm ‚Äúonly‚Äù 39 years old so i guess that helps. i don‚Äôt drink anymore, whereas i used to drink a LOT. i‚Äôm going back to college, i‚Äôm going to do it online. i probably shouldn‚Äôt be around anymore, but here i am.

1aon377,stroke,1707697877.0,"I lost my dad on Thursday, I posted on here a couple of months ago about his stroke in November which affected his occipital lobe and resulted in complete vision loss. Then in December he had a second stroke in hospital and had left side neglect and speech impairment amongst other issues including swallowing.

I wanted to post as I want to know if people think these two situations (his second stroke and passing) could have been avoided.

His second stroke happened in hospital in December. In the morning he unfortunately pulled out his cathetor resulting in a bleed. The doctors decided to not give him his morning blood thinner (he was on one which was twice a day at that point). I realise this choice probably needed to be made as he could have never stopped bleeding if they gave it to him. However a few hours later physio come round and sit him up in bed - his blood pressure dropped and they had to put him in oxygen. He also suffered from a fib. Around an hour after this he suffered his second stroke. As I haven‚Äôt started an official investigation yet I don‚Äôt know if the physios were aware of the bleeding issue and not having any blood thinners or not. But I don‚Äôt think he should have been exerted in any way, and this is what led to the second stroke which was utterly devastating for him.

Then fast forward to Thursday, my mum was visiting and was told earlier in the day they‚Äôd given him a sedative to take him for a scan. They‚Äôd then crushed some pain killers into a mousse and fed it to him. Now he hadnt been eating really and rarely took oral meds. I‚Äôd even tried the evening before with him and he spat them everywhere. My mum noticed a gargling noise like fluid on his lungs. Which the hca hasn‚Äôt noticed. He was on a supervised ward which was barely ever supervised. She called her over and she wasn‚Äôt particularly bothered so my mum got a nurse over who again didn‚Äôt seem bothered but eventually decided to suction him. Lo and behold out comes loads of mousse and crushed medication. Who on earth feeds someone this stuff if they‚Äôre basically comatosed? My mum said he sounded better but not completely clear and the nurse said they‚Äôd keep an eye on him. My mum was leaving as visiting had ended but noticed he was wet and told the nurse who said she would get him changed. This was at 7.30pm - my mum left his say bolt upright. At 9.30pm he was found unresponsive and died just after 10pm. My guess is they changed him, laid him flat and he still had stuff in his throat and he couldn‚Äôt get enough oxygen. 

We will be ordering a post mortem and if it concludes he had this medication on his lungs we will be suing them. Plus I think their negligence caused his second stroke.

166zf4m,stroke,1693549999.0,"Thank you for the add ‚ù§Ô∏è I hope it's okay if I tell you all my story. 

It's been been almost 13 years since I had 3 strokes from complications of myocarditis induced heart failure when I was 15 in 2011.
I caught the flu and for some reason, with no pre existing heart conditions, it turned into myocarditis and they didn't catch it until I had my first seizure but my heart stopped shortly after they did a spinal tap and chest xray, egule waiting to get a report on the xray from a radiologist in a city 4 hours away. They did 37 minutes of CPR while I was taken to the airport to be flown by plane to Salt Lake City where they could put me on ECMO and in a drug induced coma to rest, and not long after, they decided on open heart surgery to install a BiVAD machine. I was in a coma for a little over 2 weeks and had gently told my parents to consider the fact I may not wake up due to extremely under-active EEG levels, and if I did wake up, I would most likely be extremely mentally impared. When I did wake up, I was paralyzed on my left side and I had gone from a healthy 125lbs to 75lbs, over the course of 2 months I relearned to cough, talk, eat/drink/swallow, use the bathroom, sit up, hold my head up, write, read, and walk. They wanted me to stay 4 months but I was extremely eager to get back home and go to high-school again, I did PT for a year or two and ditched my wheelchair in that time as well. But now I wish I had done more, for longer, I wish I could go back and tell my teenage self that the work we put in then will improve our lives do much more at my current age.. I have so many regrets in that.  

They think I had one of my strokes during CPR, one was due to a blood clot in the bivad tubes, but they couldn't locate the 3rd. I don't remember what kind if strokes I had, I still have moderate to severe issues with my balance tremors, I'm on Primodone which greatly helps,  I also tried to see a a specific neurologist to see if I qualified for deep brain stimulation surgery but even after reviewing 500+ pages of notes, I was told that my falls and tremors were most likely psychosomatic which I took to heart until June 3rd if this year.  I was in a very bad car accident and they did a CT Scan due to memory loss and noted the following which I'm assuming was from one of my strokes and is responsible for my lasting issues.

""hypodense focus in right basal ganglia may represent subacute/chronic infarct. 

Well circumscribed hypodensity in right basal ganglia.""

Last Saturday I was out of town and got up early to make breakfast when I got a little extra dizzy. My eye sight tunneled briefly and I just felt off. I sat down quick to get my bearings then got back up to get my bagel and coffee and figured I maybe was just a little low on sugars. The feeling was brief and before I knew it I was ""fine."" I went upstairs to my hotel room and took a little nap before continuing about my day.

Later I woke up and I had a slight migraine plus vision loss in my right eye (peripheral). Again, I did not think anything of it as I was a soccer player and suffered a concussion where I have gotten migraines occasionally since high school. But the vision loss was strange. I continued about my day after taking Excedrine and the pain subsided but the vision loss was still there. That same evening I ran 16 miles as part of my regular training since I did not know I had an infarct. 

Fast forward to Tuesday and the vision loss was still prevalent so I went to my local hospital where I was surprisingly diagnosed with a stroke. They did the whole shebang for me: CT Scan, MRI, Echocardiogram, full blood panel including blood for hematologist, etc. Everything was not out of the ordinary and At this point they are lost. I will be getting a TEE in a couple weeks to officially rule out (or rule in) PFO. 

I am so thankful and grateful things were not worse but at the same time I am extremely terrified of it happening again. I have completely altered my diet. The doctors have given me the pass to continue running some doctors even being very adamant that I continue being active. 

I recently joined this sub to gain some perspective but also not feel so alone. Also to get words of advice on how to navigate as this is all new to me.

A couple of days ago, midway during my morning run, I suddenly lost vision in one eye and quickly started getting a headache. A day later I noticed some partial Horner's syndrome (droopy eyelid, uneven pupil sizes). I also developed a little bit of pulsatile tinnitus. I didn't have any neurological deficits, however.

Upon describing these symptoms to the doctor, they suggested I go straight to the ER.

An MRI and CAT scan revealed that indeed have a dissected left artery. They said that I haven't had a stroke, and sent me home with some baby aspirin and some blood pressure meds (apparently I'm hypertensive and I didn't even know about it).

Besides being diligent with my meds, what can I expect now? I started doing some research on CAD and some sources I'm seeing are saying that the risk of stroke or some kind of ischemic event in the first two weeks is pretty high (\~70 %). That's a lot higher than I expected, and I must admit it's sent me into a bit of a panic attack. Am I basically just sitting around waiting to have a (probable) stroke, until the ""danger period"" passes? I like my brain and don't want to lose any part of it. :( Is the risk profile really that high given this diagnosis, even if we caught it early and I'm starting on meds?

As a hypochondriac and chronic worrier, what I've been reading is giving me some panic attacks about the whole situation, not sure how I can mentally survive the next couple of weeks...and yes I know that stressing about it makes things worse. :(

My boyfriend (30M) got into a crash 2.5 weeks ago today. Aside from a few broken bones, his head sustained massive injury to the left side causing a stroke. His first week he was in a medically induced coma. Eyes shut but moving his body slightly (right  side weak), eyes unresponsive.
Cut to now his eyes are open, looking around, he is aware and can move his body and often slides down in the bed to the point that they have him strapped down. 
But he is not responsive to questions. Cannot talk. To be honest he is acting like an infant. Behavior is, for lack of better description, quite retarded, infantile.

One year ago I was released from my 7-week hospital stay following a hemorrhagic stroke in my right basal ganglia. One thing I noticed during my stay was that my emotional state was surprisingly even-keeled, which surprised me and I think was a positive in my recovery. I suffer from clinical depression and have a history of anxiety attacks and doom spiraling. However, depression was not an issue following stroke and I was able to focus on therapy without getting down or discouraged. Over the last year depressive episodes have also been non-existent. Additionally, in the hospital my appetite was seriously reduced. I didn‚Äôt ever feel overly hungry. I just ate when it was mealtime because that‚Äôs what I was supposed to do. The combination of this with hours of therapy seemed to kick off some serious wright loss which continued over the last year.

However, this salve from my depression also goes in the opposite direction because I don‚Äôt feel any emotions intensely. I‚Äôm a dude that loves blubbering at movies but now I recognize something sad or inspiring is happening but there is no intense emotional response. I‚Äôm also a big sports fan, but emotional reactions to wins or losses are definitely muted. This is not necessarily bad, but it is different. I don‚Äôt get that intense pleasure response from good food and my libido is buried. Sexual thought and fantasies are rare and my desire for sex with my partner or masturbating has seriously receded and that does suck.

I am a different person now, and again it‚Äôs not necessarily bad. I do appreciate this calmer version of myself and I think this has helped me with my recovery. But I miss pleasure and intensity. Maybe this trade off is worth it. Time will tell. But the concern is that because there is significant brain damage, maybe this is who I am from now on and some things are just permanently gone. My brain has worked overtime in getting me functioning again, so maybe Jerry-rigging emotions back together is low priority, especially since things like depressive episodes are being held at bay instead of interfering with day-to-day life.

It's a slow process but with high chances that if she stays responsive, she will not lose her motor skills.

Though there are days when I feel like I'm losing my Mom everyday. Maybe it's just the amount of the meds she takes everyday (antidepressants anti seizures etc etc).

I've been reading a lot of posts here to stay patient. Gotta trust Mom's neuro for now.

s4gg5m,stroke,1642238121.0,"Sorry this is long but I think you need the entire story to really understand. 

My mom (61) had a blood clot stroke 10 days ago in her thalamus. Things were definitely going to be different (lots of therapy) but she was ok. She could talk and sort of walk but couldn‚Äôt feel her right side. She could carry a conversation but would forget what you said sometimes or repeat things. Her eye sight was also ‚Äúpixelated‚Äù, as she described it. 

5 days later she had a second stroke in her brain stem (worst case scenario) while still in the hospital. She was immediately unconscious and was into surgery within two hours. They partially unblocked the artery but the damage was done. 

She has now been in a state of semi unconsciousness for 5 days. 

She is on a ventilator because she was not breathing on her own. She is now making tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny (did I say tiny?) efforts to breath with the ventilator. But it‚Äôs more than it was 5 days ago!

She has loooots of spontaneous muscle twitches when she is ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù (I think). When the doctors do their tests on her (move eyebrows, squeeze hand, move foot, react to pain or light) she will inconsistently do the moving or squeezing but there‚Äôs no reaction in the eyes to light at all. 

However, for some reason she seems to respond to me quite well. On the first occasion that we noticed she‚Äôd respond better to me, she was responding to my requests to move almost every time. I even established a yes (squeeze hand) and no (wiggle foot) system and she was able to answer some basic questions correctly (eg. if I am Heather wiggle your hand. If I am Andrew wiggle your foot). I felt elated knowing she could really hear me. I tried it again later in the night with less successful results. She was probably tired. 

Today she was unresponsive the first two times I visited but the third time she was ON! She was doing everything I asked and this time was even able to answer yes and no questions by shaking or nodding her head. I even asked her if she wanted to live like this (a mind without a body, as the doctors keep saying) and she shook her head no. Then I asked if she wanted us to let her go and she hesitated, scrunched up her eyes and her lips quivered as though she was crying. I asked her if she was sad and crying and she nodded her head. There were other significant responses too but the other big one that seems like she was really hearing me was that she didn‚Äôt want to let go of my hand and when I tried pulling away to grab something she would grip my hand harder and harder. 

Ok to wrap this up:

The doctor keeps saying that although he agrees that she is understanding us, due to the nature of her stroke it‚Äôs very unlikely that she will ever function independently (ie. walking, talking, eating, toileting). We know she doesn‚Äôt want to be a mind without a functioning body but‚Ä¶does this sound like something she could potentially sort of recover from? Am I seeing progress where there is none? Of course, the Doctor or nurse are never there when I get her to do these great response so I feel like they aren‚Äôt truly seeing her capabilities and maybe aren‚Äôt believing my excited reports.

While different types of bladder and bowel dysfunction can occur post-stroke, incontinence specifically means that you have poor control of your bladder, your bowels, or both.

Just as you may experience weakness or nerve issues in your arm, hand, leg, or foot after a stroke, you may develop similar issues with the muscles and nerves of your pelvic floor that support bladder and bowel functions. There may also be an interruption in the communication between those nerves and the spinal cord or brain.‚ÄãIn my newest article, Managing Bowel and Bladder Problems, I write about the most common types of bowel and bladder problems that survivors experience after stroke, complications, and a range of treatment options.

Just like the topic of [sex after stroke](https://elysenewland.com/articles/sex-after-stroke), it's obvious that bladder and bowel problems are not discussed enough. This is likely because talking about bladder and bowel issues can be embarrassing and uncomfortable. We don't talk about that kind of thing in ""polite society.""

Looking at the percentage of survivors just experiencing incontinence, it's imperative that we talk about the stuff that might be a little embarrassing.

OT has found a way to blend science and art together in order to help people do the things they value. I understand and apply scientific evidence, but never lose sight that *listening* and a person's *experience* are often the most important tools.

On Tuesday I left in the morning to work as normal and saw my father a few minutes before leaving at 7:30am. All was well and we exchanged good mornings while I handed him a cup of coffee. Left for work to return that evening around 5:30pm. 

Upon returning home I walked in the door and he was making spaghetti. We chatted for a few about the day and then I went for a 50 minute run. When I got home he was starting to boil the pasta, and while putting a load of laundry in the wash realized I was out of detergent. Walked back into the kitchen to inform him I was going to run to the store (mile away) to get detergent, and asked if we needed anything else. He told me he walked to the store earlier, and got eggs, pancake mix, and the next thing he couldn‚Äôt think of the words which I attributed to him being old and forgetful. 

Went to the store and returned 15 minutes later to find him finishing the pasta. He was straining it over the sink (had made in a standard pot with a lid) and he then dumped it all in the sink. I laughed and informed him there is a pasta pot in the cupboard and pulled it out to show him. He looked and it blankly, and didn‚Äôt say a thing. I joked about it, and then went on my way to grab food. After I had my pasta and sauce, and while he was grabbing his I asked him a question which I don‚Äôt remember exactly. When he replied I couldn‚Äôt understand a single thing he said, it was as if he was speaking a foreign language I never heard. I looked at him, and he didn‚Äôt look right so I asked him if he was ok? His reply was the same jumbled mess of un recognizable words. At that point I said ‚Äúwe are going to the hospital‚Äù, and decided he was having a stroke. 

Turns out he has an undiagnosed AVM and it started bleeding. Thankfully I have one of the best neuro units in the nation three miles from my home. I know this because not a year ago I was diagnosed with an un-ruptured cerebral aneurysm and was treated there. Got him to ER and they ran stroke protocol immediately. Thankfully the bleed was slow and with blood pressure meds they were able to limit the effects. 

Angiogram the following morning to plug the AVM issue and a few days later he is doing well. His speech is still affected but has recovered a lot (60%?) since admitting. Today he moved from ICU to a downgraded recovery unit, and tomorrow we talk with the speech therapist to game plan the weeks, and months moving forward. Thankfully he‚Äôs still here, and speech seems to be the only motor function affected by the bleed.

1fdz1z0,stroke,1726020035.0,"My 97 year old father had a stroke 2.5 weeks ago.  I‚Äôm not sure the type of stroke he had.  His motor skills are fine, but cognitively he‚Äôs not doing well.  When he is lucid, about 50% of what he says makes sense.  Today I went to the hospital to feed him lunch and as I walked in, the nursing staff was restraining him (arms and legs) because he was becoming unruly.  He is at a top tier hospital (UCLA) so I‚Äôm not questioning the quality of his care.  I think they are right to restrain him because he tries to pull out his IV‚Äôs, tries to take off his gown, tries to get out of bed (he would collapse).  

So, today after they restrained him, he told me that he was going to kill me and kept lunging at me.  He said, ‚ÄúYou are not my daughter.‚Äù I finally got him to calm down and he even managed to eat lunch, but I‚Äôm worried that this will be our future. Will he ever be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again.

1f5sgzc,stroke,1725124803.0,"This is going to be a long post, so sorry in advance. If you stick around I would greatly appreciate feedback. 

I am a 37/f. When this all went down, I was 35. 
Around a week before the full incident (Nov 2022), my left outside fingers started going numb. I was working out 5-6 days a week so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it since sometimes that happened; especially in my left side. (Scapula issues)
I was at work and I felt like it had been almost moving towards my whole hand that day and just kinda felt off. Later on in the day, I felt a zap in my body. Felt like I had been shocked from my feet to the top of my head. My entire left side went numb and tingly. I went to the bathroom to check my face and I had no drooping, I could still talk and I didn‚Äôt have any headache. So I just worked the rest of the day and that night, ended up going to just urgent care as my youngest son was sick. I decided I would mention to the doctor was kinda happened that day. She was shocked I was there and not at the ER so she told me either call your husband to take you or I‚Äôm calling an ambulance. I go to the hospital, obviously I am treated emergent because they think it‚Äôs a stroke. My BP is high, but other than that everything is coming back normal. CT, MRI, spinal tap. Two days later I am sent home with a cane because my walking and balance is not stable. I go back to work that Monday and it is progressively worse. Like I can barely walk or move. So I go back to the ER, they run all the tests again minus spinal tap and I am basically told I need to see a psychologist because there is nothing wrong with me they can find. Fast forward through January and I still am barely able to walk, whole left side is numb and tingly, can‚Äôt feel the urge to pee, I have zero strength and can barely do most stuff. I go to my PCP and she agrees something isn‚Äôt wrong and decides to refer me to Mayo Clinc and in the meantime requests a new MRI with/w/o contrast. It comes back with two lesions and I‚Äôm told I had a small stroke. One near my brain stem, the other one on the bottom part of my brain. (Locations I‚Äôm not exactly sure of) Mayo denies me because ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt exhausted all of my resources‚Äù. I end up going to the ER two more times because I have these ‚Äúflares‚Äù where I can go a couple weeks to maybe a month or so where I‚Äôm ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. And by normal I mean I still have less strength, numb and tingly but it‚Äôs a a lower percentage than what my ‚Äúflares‚Äù are. I would say my baseline of function compared to before all this happened is like 60% out of 100%. Then as the flares happen, it goes well below 60%. I also have had more symptoms pop up - vision issues, trouble swallowing, extreme pain at times, no to low grip or hand/finger movement, extreme brain fog, jumbled words or not able to speak clearly, speech is very altered, and so on. I‚Äôve had all the heart tests, nerve testing, and they‚Äôve all come back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. (Side note: My nerve test was awful. I couldn‚Äôt do most things the neurologist asked me to do and he squeezed and moved my hand the entire time making me do those things. I ended up with bruising in my entire forearm because of this.)
 A year ago (Aug 2023) I was finally referred to a neurologist. The one I ended up seeing didn‚Äôt even know I had a ‚Äústroke‚Äù and thought I was being seen for migraines. He had ZERO imaging sent to him so I ended up showing him off my phone since I can access it from there. The only thing he said was  you have the brain of a 76 yr old and sent me out. 
I called the office back and asked for a switch transfer of care to a neurologist who specializes in strokes. They accepted and I was to be seen in February 2024. I had high hopes that I was going to get the answers I needed after more than a year of not really knowing. He had zero imaging, test results or anything. Was going solely off of the neurologist I had seen before. He told me to sign some paperwork to my imaging could be sent to him and he would see me in 3 months. I was scheduled 6 months out with him being booked. I called the office 2 months in advance asking if they received my imaging so I could get an answer. I never got a call back. I ended up getting all my imaging and bringing it to my next appointment (July 3,2024). He didn‚Äôt even review it. Again, he went off everything that was hearsay. Telling me it‚Äôs a brain issue for everything I told him. He did all the strength and movement tests and I am noticeably weak and everything and he did absolutely nothing. Told me I‚Äôd have to deal with it. We mentioned MS ONLY because we‚Äôve had a couple of medical professionals ask me about it and I was told absolutely not. My tests showed nothing towards that. (From two years ago!)

I still am having all of these issues to this day, and in fact am getting ready to go through another ‚Äúflare‚Äù. 

Has anyone had experiences like this? Including in the medical area, recovery and timing (such as my flares). To my research- if all of these issues were from my stroke it would be a straight across the board recovery. I wouldn‚Äôt get more normal and the get worse. And constantly fluctuate with that.

1esgn4s,stroke,1723679602.0,"My pcp referred me to a neuro after I reported some moments of confusion and brain fog starting earlier this year. The neuro told me she was completely positive I was fine but decided to send me for an mri just in case because my dad died of brain cancer. 

The mri revealed a chronic infarct. The neuro is now referring me to a specialist appointment almost six months out because it's nothing acute, and because the infarct's placement does not correspond with my symptoms. She said the stroke wasn't a big deal and not to be worried about it, but that she wanted me to follow up because it was confusing why I'd had it in the first place - I'm 32f with zero risk factors associated with strokes (and I had my blood work done up before the mri so we did confirm that).

I'm glad she says it's not a big deal, but I'm feeling really stressed about having no clear next steps until the end of the year. I'm sorry to complain, I know people on this sub are dealing with much larger issues but I'm not sure who to talk to about this as I don't want to upset my family any further with my stress. As someone with anxiety, I'm just feeling scared to continue as I was with the thought that something I am doing might be contributing to a future stroke, since I know the first one makes me more susceptible to a follow up. My work is on a major upswing at the moment and I'm not sure if I should be concerned about more intentionally limiting my stress (which would absolutely lead to an inferior outcome with my project) or if I'm just being melodramatic and letting my anxiety freak me out.

Story of my beloved dad, he lived a difficult life full of problems. 
He had a x4 bypass 30 years ago, the doctors were giving him max 10 years expectancy, he did it though and reached 30 with 5 more angioplasties. APRIL 2024: a big huge hemorrhagic stroke. Big hematoma in his brain. Left hemiparesis, dysphagia, disorientation, delirium, illusions. He improved only dysphagia and delirium. It was too early for improvements though, doctors were waiting the hematoma to shrink. When hematoma shrinks, then brain remakes the problematic surface. 
He didnt improve left side. His brain didnt recognise this side. He had bed sore stage iv, and klebsiella entered it. 
JULY 7TH 2024:
He was finally so weak, he got an UTI,his system couldn't fight it with antibiotics, and ended up from urosepsis. 
Lesson 1: if patient can't move, turn from side to side your loved one as often as you can. Bed sores can easily appear. And kill.... 
Lesson 2: if you suffered an hemorrhagic stroke, dont get disappointed if you dont improve fast. Wait your brain to heal. 
Lesson 3: Train your/his brain by making him recall situations. Its important for the brain. 

Pray for my dad, i was hoping to see him walk again and be with us. He survived this big steoke and ended up from something else. 
Ask me anything if you want. I became hemorrhagic stroke pro.... 
Please pray for his soul. 
I pray for all of you. Xx

I was in a car wreck two months ago and went to urgent care and they diagnosed me with a back, neck, and shoulder sprain. I started seeing a chiropractor on my own accord because I was hurting. On my fourth visit, the chiropractor adjusted my neck and I immediately became very dizzy and started throwing up. They kept telling me it was normal and I would be fine in 15 minutes. 3.5 hours go by and I'm still vomiting and unable to walk due to extreme vertigo. They kept me in a dark room and tried different things to help the dizziness/nausea but it did nothing. They even made a joke about me going out drinking the night before and that's why I was so sick. I managed to call my friend to pick me up because I was in no condition to walk, let alone drive. 3 chiropractors checked on me during this period and said I was fine. They put me in a wheelchair and took me to my friend's car while I continued to throw up in her car. The office never called EMS. My friend drove me straight to the ER where they determined I had a vertebral artery dissection that resulted in a stroke. I was in critical care for 6 days and had to get transported to a different hospital.

1d2yzb4,stroke,1716941926.0,"My mom (55) had a stroke Sunday night, multiple strokes according to the doctor. They impacted the left hemisphere of her brain and were caused by a clot in the aorta. She currently has some level of control over all her limbs, but shows clear weakness in her right leg and especially her right arm, which she has almost no control over. Her speech is impacted and she can't form words, but she can relay ton and seems to be able to respond and understand what is said to her for the most part. She is currently on a heparin drip and hoping there is no need for surgery, thus far everything is looking good, but its only been about 48 hours.

I am her eldest son (31). I have disabilities of my own, physical ones impact me harder than the mental ones do, but it keeps ringing in my head that I'm not the best choice to tackle everything that needs to get done for her. Unfortunately, I am the best choice in this situation, as my brother has autism that limits his ability to understand the situation and make choice. My grandmother is due for back surgery any day, and the only other person close enough is my Uncle, whose kid graduated high school this like past week or so and they had plans to do some traveling before college. My mom would be pissed if they cancelled their plans for her, so we all agree that I am the best option to take care of her right now, or at least make whatever touch decisions I have to for her care.

I live in MO, and she lives in TN. Currently I am not out there as I had to figure things out for watching my cat while I'm gone, as well as pack enough to prepare to be there for a bit, but I will be heading there tomorrow morning with my dog. My partner is currently out of state at a wedding, but she will be flying in to Nashville so I can pick her up and she can help me with everything. Last bit of important information is that my mom has 3 dogs that she lives alone with and mean a lot to her, and a friend of hers is watching them right now until I get there.

Everything I've read, both on this subreddit and elsewhere, has indicated to me that it is both too early to tell what will happen, but also that everything is looking better than expected. The nurse told me this morning that my mom is able to sort of form words that are hard to understand, which is a large step up from groans with tone differentiation. I'm incredibly anxious about what might happen next, and incredibly anxious about how to handle stuff like the dogs and her finances. I want to be there for her, but my partner and I were in the middle of preparing to move out of state and uncertain if we can put those plans on the backburner while this all happens. 

Her finances will probably not be that bad. Once I get there, I can figure out what her bills are and who to contact to figure out what her benefits are and get them started. My grandmother is gonna support us financially in the case that we need it for anything, which she fortunately has the ability to do. The dogs are the part I know the least about what to do, mostly because they are not the best trained and no one I know currently would be willing to take them in while she recovers. I also don't know if she will recover enough to be able to take care of the dogs herself, which I know will break her heart and really hope it doesn't come to that.

I know that theres a chance she ends up in a nursing home or something for continued care, which I think is the best option for her recovery should it be needed. Otherwise, theres a chance that I might need to be the person to take care of her, and I don't think I can do that in the long term. I know she would be pissed as well if she knew that I was putting my life on hold for this situation. 

I know it is early, but my stomach is in a knot with anxiety, my mind is racing, and the only solace I tend to get is when I solve whatever the next thing is with regards to her care. Tomorrow will be a long day with a long drive, but at least I'll finally be able to see her and remind her that she isn't alone. She is one of the strongest people I know, even seeing her current recovery speed blows my mind and surprised the nurse, and part of me fully believes that she will end up fully recovering. But I also know that can take months, years even, and I know that we are still early and the progress she has already made might be the only progress she makes. 

I guess the advice I need is just what to do for the future with this. What to expect, what I can do now to prepare, and how I can best help her without burning myself into the ground? I don't want to destroy myself for this, because that doesn't help either of us, but I also feel the need to do everything I can to make sure she is ok. I think the dogs are the top priority right now, trying to make sure that my mom doesn't have to worry about losing her dogs will bring her a lot of peace right now. Everything else is kinda just talking to insurance, her job, and the case manager to find out what to do next, but I know that if enough time elapses then her house (which she rents) and her stuff might need to be managed in some way. I feel woefully underqualified and woefully limited due to my disabilities to be able to manage all of this, but I also know that if I don't, no one will and the results will be far worse for her, which I won't stand for. I don't know what the future looks like right now, and I'm scared of nearly every result because I'm scared that I might not be able to do enough to help.

1b635wl,stroke,1709530639.0,"Maybe a rant, maybe explaining, maybe looking for understanding.
I had a stroke in 2017 (at age 47). I didn't realize the damage it had done at the time. I knew something was happening to me but didn't know what really. In 2020 I started to feel dizzy / lightheaded. It got worse and worse. It got to the point where I felt an electric zap was being delivered to my brain along with the dizziness. What caused the electric zap I guess I'll never know. But people talking to me and having to listen seemed to make it worse. Even alone walking I would get this, so maybe people talking to me wasn't it. While the electric zap is now gone, thank god because it was a torture, the dizziness remains all the time. Hasn't stopped for 1 minute since 2020.
My god I was strong before this stroke. I used to think even bullets couldn't slow me down. I never went out looking to get shot, but imagined I would be fine if I did. Hard to believe this stroke has taken me down as it has. I'm tired of hearing how I'm lucky, it could have been worse. I was in the stroke ward at the hospital. I could see how others were worse off, but I don't feel lucky.
I have over time felt the need to explain to others what it is like. And over time it has changed how I explain it. I used to tell others it's like moving from stereo world into mono world. Later I would show shredded paper, take some and toss it away and put back together. It looks like a full sheet of paper, but we know something is missing. My latest way of explaining comes from Star Trek, it is from the original series and it's called, The Enemy Within. This is the first episode I know of that had two of the same actor. They would later go on to have two of everyone sooner or later. In this episode Cpt Kirk is duplicated in a transporter malfunction. We later find out that it is indeed his personality that has been split into two separate people. The ending of course fixes this by joining them back together. Parts of me have been separated from me, and there gone now. Like they died while separated and will never be rejoined to the rest of me. If I were taken to a magical doctor, and all I had to do is tell him whats missing and he can put it back. I don't know, all I know is something is missing. I hope this making sense. Talking has become a chore, something that has been so effortless is now hard work. I believe this has made me combative. I think my words carefully so that I do not have to think of a different way of saying something. When someone doesn't get what I'm saying or asks a question about what I'm saying, I get annoyed. Yes I know I shouldn't do that, but it's too late after sounding and looking annoyed in the moment. I almost wish I could communicate with others via usb in the brain. Know what I'm trying to say without me having to find words to express what I want to say. Because when you don't get my meaning, I have to think of a new way and say it. This makes more work for me. I understand I must, but I can't help but get annoyed at it. I have tinnitus now that never stops. A hissing in both ears, some days it is less but never gone. If i get a hint or in a surrounding that I think you may not hear me, I tend to yell what I'm saying without knowing I'm yelling. Even saying Have a Nice Day while yelling it can be taken the wrong way. I am aware I do this but cannot fix it.
I have aches, pains and weakness that I do not understand. My back hurts, my knees hurt, but I've had no injury. Laying down or sitting down I see something done, I think to myself I can do that. But when I get up and do it I find I cannot. I have been physical all my life, sports, work, now it seems to can do very little. I could never see a life where I feel helpless and depending on others. I don't like me now. But that ol will to live kicks in and I walk and exercise everyday, it's 7 years since the stroke and it's getting harder. If you tell anyone how you feel, oh that sounds like depression, here is a pill and someone to talk too. But who your talking too has all there faculties, how can they possibly understand. I can no longer function the way I used to, and it's called depression. Okay lets call it that. Yes strokes can cause depression, but the fix is I believe is unknown.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1b635wl/feeling_like_only_other_stroke_survivors_can/,feeling like only other stroke survivors can understand,Survivor Discussion,17,8,0.96

Late June he had some chest pain. He went to an urgent care center and they said to go to the hospital. He didn't do so immediately, and them my mom forced him to go. While in the ER he got chest pain again and they said he had a small heart attack. They did orthoscopic surgery and had to back out as there were more blockages than anticipated. He was sent via ambulance to another hospital with better care and technology. There they suggested either open heart surgery or stents. He opted for stents and, honestly, I don't blame him. Post surgery he seemed quite well and wanted to walk around more. He came home I guess early July technically and is on a slew of medications. 


Last night he wasn't feeling well but wouldn't do anything. My mom thought he may have gotten a cold from my son. His behavior was a little off but he was adamant he was fine.


Today he was with a client when his face looked droopy and his words were either not making sense or weren't words - unsure which. He was brought to the hospital via ambulance and they did a CT scan and then surgery within the same hour. The surgeon and doctor confirmed it was a stroke in the main artery to the back of the brain (starts with a ""B""). They removed the blockage and blood was flowing normally, but I know it's not all dandy because of that.


When I went to see him post surgery it was honestly horrifying to me. Yes, he was still groggy from anesthesia. The nurses and other personnel were supportive and stated he was doing well. But I had never seen my Dad in such a state. When he had the heart surgery he was awake and seemed normal. With this... when I walked in he looked dead. His dentures were out, his eyes were closed, he looked very still... He was barely conscious and could mumble some words. I was able to talk to him and he did make sense and could comprehend what I was saying. But it's still scary. The PA we talked to seemed very positive, though. 

I... I didn't know where else to go. This has been super stressful on top of other issues in my life included my own health. I'm hoping he comes out completely normal.

It went well, I got everything I need and didn't have issues pushing the cart around with one hand. As someone who has become disabled later on in life I notice most people take half a second to process my state of being and usually get out of my way. Or in many cases, don't make a fuss if I get in theirs. 

Anyway, as I was about to go the the register I noticed out of the corner of my eye a kid. He was maybe 11, 12, 13 at the most. He was limping. I must be so naive because the first thought that popped in my head was ""oh man, that kid must have it hard"". Then, he began limping faster. Then I noticed his arm and I realized in that moment that he was in fact mocking me and he was being so mean spirited about it that his intention was to get ahead of me to make sure I saw him.

This was genuinely a first time I had been confronted in this way. To be honest I never really gave it much thought, obviously I knew there were going to be insensitive people but it just didn't seem important to put my energy into something I can't change. Don't get me wrong, I am very insecure about my disability. I don't care what people think about me, I never have. But I do feel shame for not taking care of my health and putting myself in this position.

Anyway, the kid. I care, but I don't care I guess. Sure, kids can be the worst. But who am I to tell him how to act when I know for a fact that I was probably just as bad. I mean, not make fun of disabled people bad, I'm not a monster. But I have definitely said some insensitive things around that age. It's not my job to parent this kid and teach him empathy, so I just acknowledge his existence and moved on with my day. Never to see him again.

I guess what I'm saying is to those of you who are maybe new to all of this, do not dwell on the small things. You are going to run into people like this kid, probably full grown adults that pay their taxes if we're being real. But you can't change them until they decide to change for themselves, so don't waste an ounce of your energy thinking about them.

12sffmg,stroke,1681949506.0,"I do a more involved routine with coins that I posted recently. Shortly after added pinching each coin to the routine I was able to open ziplock bags and tear open candy wrappers instead of using scissors. I have about 50 coins that I store in a coffee mug and use for my daily occupational therapy. First I carefully pour them on a dish towel on my dining room table. The dish towel m adds friction that helps stop the coins from rolling off the table. I pick each coin up one at a time. I use a different finger and thumb  pair each time. Then I pinch the coin as hard as I can just before I drop it back into the cup. That exercise helps a lot. Since my main goal for. OT is increasing my typing speed so I can make more money,I also do a ‚Äúfinger dance‚Äù  each time I put a coin back in the coffee mug, I wag the  finger that was half of the finger and thumb pair that picked up the last coinnnthen straighten it fully. Then I curl it to  double tap the table l in a typing motion after the coin is back in the mug.  I do this routine until I have gone through the appropriately fifty coins twice. When I am done  with my coins I I try 100 times to catch a tennis ball. I don‚Äôt bounce it or throw it high. I use my healthier hand to throw the ball a few inches directly into my affected palm. I tried this exercise because I hope to get back to ball sports one day. In the  first few weeks after my stroke I didn‚Äôt even have the coordination to clap. I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised that two years later I was unable to catch a tennis ball thrown directly into my palm from four inches away.  But I couldn‚Äôt catch the ball consistently untiI tried over a thousand times. (One hundred repetitions daily). IAnd I was surprised that  the first day I attempted this closing my hand fast enough to have a chance to catch the ball meant my fingers swatted the ball across the room 80% of the time. . I have done this exercise every day for three weeks and I am proud to say that I can catch the ball over ninety times out of one hundred now. This isn‚Äôt just an exercise of eye - hand coordination. The final split second of catching a ball doesn‚Äôt involve vision. To close your hand in the right spit-second you have to feel the ball hit your palm. I have learned how important regaining my sense of touch is In my efforts to regain my fine motor skills fortunately the OT work I do with coins has not only helped me move my fingers better, it has also helped me feel the coins (and everything else) better. I realized that if I can‚Äôt properly feel the thing in my hand I cannot hold it well. So developing my touch- hand coordination with the tennis ball may have practical everyday application.

Post surgery, he was kept in a medically induced coma for 24 hours and when he woke up he was unable to move or feel his left side and had a difficult time speaking since the left side of his face was paralyzed, however he thankfully seemed mentally ok and was able to answer questions just fine and his memory seemed unaffected. While I was aware of the challenges he faced, I was pretty optimistic at that point for at least a limited recovery.

Unfortunately since then it‚Äôs been mostly downhill, with the occasional bright spot. He got pneumonia within the first few days in the hospital and began to have a few small seizures in the ICU. The hospital moved him out of the ICU and into the neurology unit after a week once the pneumonia was under control, and apparently he may have had a larger seizure at that time but the doctors can‚Äôt definitively say so. Since then (about a week ago) he has been much less responsive, sleeping all the time, and much less communicative. He still recognizes me and is able to answer some questions but takes much longer to answer and can only mumble or whisper. He also still can‚Äôt swallow and they inserted a PEG tube last week. Today the doctor had a nurse from the palliative care team speak with me regarding possible hospice care if he doesn‚Äôt improve in the next few weeks.

What I‚Äôm trying to figure out is why the apparent decline post stroke and now that the seizures are under control? I guess I thought the stroke would‚Äôve done the bulk of the damage and he would pretty much recover from there, but I guess it‚Äôs more complex than that. Anyone have any similar experiences either themselves or with a relative or friend that can shed some light on probable outcomes for my father?

In November 2020 my father had an ischemic stroke in the right side of his brain at the age of 61, resulting in total paralysis of his left arm and leg. 

Up until now we were told that regaining movement in his left limbs is impossible. And we tried to make our peace with that.

However, I don‚Äôt want to stop trying. I‚Äôm wondering if any of you - survivors, caregivers, therapists - have encountered any opportunities that might be worth to look into for us.

10v1r8k,stroke,1675672769.0,"First off I want to thank everyone who replied to me on my previous post. We‚Äôre on day 23 now and things are slowly getting better. 

For a brief recap, my husband had emergency open heart surgery for aortic dissection. The surgery went well and his heart is recovering great. A few days after surgery it became clear that he was having some neurological issues. An MRI revealed a bunch of small strokes. None of them hit the major parts. And I‚Äôm told to be thankful that it wasn‚Äôt one major stroke. I am. As hard as it is to say this I have accepted that where we are right now is probably the vest case scenario for what his situation was. 

His blood pressure has finally stabilized after a lot of experimentation with different medications. He‚Äôs also not getting as agitated when he wakes up. His body is doing good. Kidneys, lungs, heart, all his internal organs are doing good. 

He still has the trach but from what I understand he‚Äôs breathing on his own and the ventilator is just providing support. So it‚Äôs a lot to be thankful for compared to just a few days ago. 

Yesterday was his first full day off the sedation. They started reducing it beginning of last week. The past 2 days he‚Äôs been so much more alert. I can see HIM in his eyes. 

He looks around a lot. Hers right side is stronger than left. They also started giving him physiotherapy 2 days ago. The physiotherapist told me that the difference between 2 days ago and yesterday is big. Yesterday he was giving him patterns and he was repeating them. Physio told me that that‚Äôs really good. 

My question for those who have been through this: how do I help him while he‚Äôs waking up and becoming more alert? 
My husband created his own music so I e been playing that to him. It‚Äôs like a diary of our life in his own voice. I‚Äôm also playing his favorite music. I‚Äôm talking to him and singing to him. Everyday I explain to him what‚Äôs going on gently and positively. 
The doctors said that he probably won‚Äôt talk or respond fully for months so I get that this may be in my head but yesterday it seemed to me that he was trying to mouth some words and he was tapping his hand with the beat. Sometimes it seems that he‚Äôs giving eye contact but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs purposeful. 
Sorry if my thoughts are jumbled I just have been barely sleeping. Any insight would be appreciated.

After talking to the doctors, I agreed, and they removed most of what turned out to be a huge cancerous tumor.some complications occurred and they had to stop the surgery before they got everything out, so they scheduled another surgery four days later (January 25th), where they got most of the remaining bits of tumor out, but unfortunately I had a stroke during this surgery, so when I woke up my left arm was paralyzed.

rq11iw,stroke,1640649309.0,"I was supposed to see my dad Christmas night but he wasn‚Äôt answering the phone. I had taken a nap during the day and arrived at his house around 8pm. I rung the bell and still no answer, I assumed he had gone to bed after having a bad day. 

It turns out he suffered a stroke sometime between 1AM Saturday and 7pm Saturday. 

I left his house at 8pm Saturday assuming he was asleep. Had I gone in and checked he would probably be doing a lot better. But I left and stayed up waiting for him to text me. After 12 hours of no answering I went back and broke into the house to find him collapsed on the floor. 

When I first entered the house I thought he was sleeping. He was snoring extremely loudly. I then noticed he was laying on the floor in the corner, there was a broken plate, his computer had fallen off his desk, i knew something was terribly wrong.

I tried waking him but he was snoring and wouldn‚Äôt wake. I called 911 and she told me to yell at him to wake up. He continued to snore but was twitching and muttering. I told him the ambulance was on the way and he gave me a thumbs up. It was so hard to see him like that, covered in a pool of urine, unable to move, unable to speak. He could hear me but couldn‚Äôt do anything.

The first responders arrived. They were talking to him and he was responding but his words were extremely slurred. He thought he was on the floor of his bedroom. They asked him if he had any previous medical issues and he was able to tell them he had two heart attacks but his speech was hard to understand. Once they wheeled him upstairs and out of the house he was out cold. He is currently in the hospital.

I have a few questions regarding strokes.

Is it a good sign that he was able to understand me when I found him and was able to slur some words to the first responder or is that common?

After the stroke hit and he was laying there on the floor alone, was he conscious? It breaks my heart to think that he hears me go over that night and ring the bell, thinking I‚Äôd go in and find him, only to be left alone and in pain for another 12 hours.

How bad is it that I left him there for an additional 12 hours? Does this mean there is a significant increase in the probability of him having permanent disability?

The doctors tried to wake him in the hospital but he is very confused. I left his phone there for him and I am hoping to get a text from him.. He can move his limbs but he still hasn‚Äôt woke up. They said he is very confused.

I‚Äôm just terribly anxious awaiting the news. They said he needs about two days for the swelling in his brain to go down, and then they will know if he will recover or be permanently disabled. I know nothing about strokes. After what I described how likely is a recovery?

Vision issues after a stroke are one of the invisible disabilities that don't get enough attention.

There are different types of vision changes that can happen after a stroke including double vision, blurry vision, visual field cuts, eye movement issues, visual processing issues, dry eye, and light sensitivity.

These changes have a significant impact on daily life. They can make watching television, driving, dressing, making a meal, and going back to work difficult.

If you're experiencing visual issues after a stroke, seek out a neuro-optometrist or neuro-ophthalmologist. You can find one close to you by searching [noravisionrehab.org](https://noravisionrehab.org/).

nmy0re,stroke,1622209047.0,"**U is for unilateral spatial neglect (or left neglect).**  
‚Äã  
Unilateral spatial neglect usually occurs after a stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain. It is one of the oddest stroke symptoms. It's a perceptual disorder that causes someone to not pay attention to one side of their body or environment (most often the left side).  
‚Äã  
Functionally, this may look like someone unable to straighten the left side of their glasses; leaving food on half of their plate; or bumping into things in the environment on their left side.

As we know, symptoms of a stroke don't happen in isolation. Survivors often experience multiple symptoms at a time. Neglect can be complicated by visual issues, one-sided weakness, and fatigue.

However, there is a strategy that can help compensate for unilateral spatial neglect: visual scanning. The first step is helping someone recognize they have a neglect issue (this can be challenging). Without awareness of the issue, scanning won't be very helpful.

If someone is aware they have a neglect issue, visual scanning can be a useful tool. You can pretend that your head is like the light in a lighthouse. Try to scan as far left and right as you can to see the whole environment. As with other aspects of stroke recovery, it takes time, repetition, and consistency (re: [neuroplasticity](https://elysenewland.com/articles/neuroplasticity-the-best-stroke-recovery-tool)), and sometimes, it takes other compensatory strategies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/nmy0re/ot_tip_u_is_for/,OT Tip: U is for...,,17,10,1.0

n6z2if,stroke,1620395763.0,"**E is for executive function.** 

Up to **75% of stroke survivors** will experience executive functioning issues post-stroke.   
Executive functioning is our ability to complete higher-level cognitive tasks like planning, sequencing, organizing, self-monitoring, flexibility in thinking, working memory, and regulating emotions.

Unfortunately, there's not been a lot of research done on cognitive rehabilitation after stroke.   
We need more high-quality studies before we can say how effective this approach is. 

However, you can try something called Drill and Practice. In this method to improve executive function, you break down a task (for example, making a sandwich) and figure out all the steps needed to complete it (gather ingredients and silverware, lay the bread on a plate, place the ingredients, put the bread together). Then you practice the steps in order, over and over, until it becomes more automatic. 

There is better research around using compensatory strategies for executive functioning.  
Some of these include using devices, apps, or gadgets for reminders, or to keep your attention on something. Other strategies include the use of external cues (like post-its, signs, etc.) in your home.

This is partial venting so it will be long, I‚Äôm sorry. In summer of 2019 I started experiencing what I thought were extreme migraines daily. They were accompanied with a constant feeling of being ‚Äúhungover‚Äù with nausea, dizziness, coordination and memory issues. 

I went to my primary care doctor a week or two later who stated it sounded like a case of vertigo that usually goes away on its own, ordered blood work, said it looked normal, suggested OTC pain killers and wrote me off. 

A few weeks(?) go by with the same symptoms until I woke up one morning with a small area of vision loss in my right eye. I went back to my doctor once again who finally referred me to an ophthalmologist and a neurologist. 

Ophthalmologist discovered damage to my retina with no known cause, but stated the damage was small and not much can be done unless it worsens. To this day I have no idea if that‚Äôs even related to the strokes, but now I just assume.

Neurologist also thought I was having severe migraines, and prescribed me migraine medication. He also decided to have an MRI done, ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù It took over a week for my insurance to approve my MRI and over another week for my neuro to call me to go in and talk about my results. He told me I had two small ischemic strokes, said I‚Äôm the youngest patient he‚Äôs ever seen with one, and prescribed me a statin and baby aspirin. He just kind of, left it at that?? Scheduled a follow up to check on my symptoms and also sent me on my way. 

To top things off, while I waited for my neurology results I started experiencing cardio symptoms and trouble breathing fully. I mentioned it to my neuro when we discussed my strokes and he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably not related‚Äù and moved on. 

So back I went to my primary care doctor when my new heart and breathing symptoms didn‚Äôt go away. She sent me to a cardiologist from there who ran several tests, couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with me, and again I was written off and told to make another appointment if things get worse. 

All of these things outlined happened between August 2019 and February 2020. I intended to go back to my doctor and ask to be referred elsewhere for second opinions, but then covid hit and given my symptoms I‚Äôve been terrified to step foot in medical offices. Now having had time to think about it and research a bit, I‚Äôve decided I want a new primary care doctor and new referrals. 

Once I am vaccinated and feel safe again, I‚Äôm going to begin a search to find good care. Has anyone else had an issue being taken seriously? Is this just the norm? What can I do to find a doctor that is genuinely going to care for me and help me find answers?

I‚Äôm having trouble accepting this, i truly believe he is depressed considering visitors were forbidden due to covid-19. 
I got myself an exception on the visitors banned a few days ago (I know I‚Äôm pushing my luck and increasing the risk) it‚Äôs only been 3 days of me seeing him after more than 2 weeks of not being able but  he tries so hard to be cooperative when I‚Äôm there that I feel I am helping him and perhaps he is a candidate for rehab? I talked to him and I‚Äôm constantly asking him affirmative questions and he moves his head yes or no if you give him time to do so. So I know he understands me and he‚Äôs in there struggling. 
Anyone had an experience of someone being diagnosed as ‚Äúnot a candidate for rehab‚Äù and had success? 
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in denial, I just don‚Äôt understand why his attitude could determine if he goes to a nursing home or to a skill nursing center.

etxnru,stroke,1579990966.0,"Hi!
So i‚Äôm writing this two weeks after my mom having a severe bleeding in the brain and almost not making it. My whole life has turned upside down and yesterday the doctor said that in cases like the one my mom has gotten the damage on the brain could be so bad that she will never be able to speak again. And it hurts so bad, i‚Äôm 22m and my mom is turning 48 on monday. I‚Äôm posting this here because i‚Äôm scared and sad I will never get my mom back. She always said to me that she would rather die than to ever become dependant on help at home and not being able to do stuff, so this could literally be her worst nightmare and it breaks my heart üò≠ 

But as right now they don‚Äôt know how severe the damage is on the brain, she‚Äôs been in an medical coma for two weeks after the operation where they took out the blood that had been filling up in there. They say she‚Äôs young and that‚Äôs a positive because she has a bigger chance to get her speech and movement back with training, but i‚Äôm terrified she won‚Äôt be able to talk ever again. I just want my mom back, there‚Äôs so much stuff we haven‚Äôt done yet together, and I miss her at home every day. Dad is also heartbroken. I felt like I needed to write this somewhere where maybe more people have gone through the same awful thing. I still have hope and pray she will push through this, but it‚Äôs still so sad and hurts. 

Update: 
Doctors says she‚Äôs not gonna make it. I feel like i‚Äôve died inside. I don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm supposed to do anymore. I feel sad all the time.

He had a stroke about a week ago and is now staying with me for recovery. He has been VERY emotional.... to be expected.

Today he told me, very excitedly, ""I FINALLY HIT THE LOTTERY""..... he is regretful for being selfish and not calling me and my sisters as often as he now thinks he should have. He is regrettful about a lot of things. But he is SO GRATEFUL that he survived this and is here to tell us how much he loves us.

bxymap,stroke,1559935074.0,"I don‚Äôt know much about strokes or anything but recently my grandma suffered a minor stroke. She is 69 years old. At the hospital, they found a scar that showed she had previously had another one but it didn‚Äôt affect her. She has had some issues with speech and been weaker than normal and it‚Äôs only her 3rd day since the stroke.


Anyways, here‚Äôs the wholesome part. My grandma didn‚Äôt realize that she would improve. I‚Äôve been staying with my grandma to keep an eye on her and we got a grocery list together and my grandmas sister came over to pick it up. She mentioned that the doctor said she would get better and my grandma responded with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get better?‚Äù and started crying.

bfon09,stroke,1555852209.0,Last Saturday my dad had a brain stem stroke. The hospital was a nightmare. We kept insisting we thought he was having a stroke. They didn‚Äôt seem to think so. They said he had an infection. Later they ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù he didn‚Äôt have a stroke and diagnosed him with Guillain Barre Syndrome. 3 days later they sat us down and said he did have a stroke and that it was devastating. He is locked in. His breathing tube got disconnected when the nurses moved him from bed to bed and they had to later resuscitate him twice. They then suggested I sign a DNR. I did not. My dad communicated (through blinking) he‚Äôd like to be resuscitated. He‚Äôs been doing better. Just....wow. It‚Äôs been a week! Keeping optimistic.

9sv3fl,stroke,1540955735.0,"It was a horrific experience. My artery broke and squished the other artery. No one (including my doctors) really has any experience with a cerebellar stroke. Part of my cerebellum is gone. I didn‚Äôt lose any muscle control, become paralyzed, or have speech issues. But because the cerebellum controls balance, some motor skills, and some speech, that‚Äôs where my issues are. I have severe balance issues. I have the physical strength to walk, but even the slightest terrain change makes me lose my balance. Most of my other issues have resolved. I was in a rehab hospital for a month, where I regained some of my mental and physical skills. I‚Äôm working on getting a therapy dog to help me balance and to help me in crowds. My brain still has trouble processing multiple things at once (loud noises, smells, lots of people, too much to look at) and I have trouble navigating crowds or stores without someone‚Äôs help. I am very easily overwhelmed by stimuli and I lose my balance and ability to think/speak well sometimes. Does anyone have experience with a cerebellar stroke? No one can tell me my long term prognosis. All I really get is ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll probably always have balance issues.‚Äù I know I am lucky it was not worse but it is still devastating emotionally and physically.
