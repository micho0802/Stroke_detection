# Stroke Detection Platform

## 1. Objective
Develop a platform that can detect strokes based on images of body movements, with a primary focus on:
- **Facial expressions**
- **Heart rates**
- **Fever patterns**

## 2. Extension
Consider extending the platform to detect other symptoms such as:
- **Pneumonia**
- **COVID-19**
- **Common colds**

## 3. Data Sources
### Stroke Detection:
- [Face Images of Acute Stroke and Non-Acute Stroke](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danish003/face-images-of-acute-stroke-and-non-acute-stroke) (Kaggle)
- [Brain Stroke CT Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/afridirahman/brain-stroke-ct-image-dataset) (Kaggle)
- [CVES Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/cves/1.0.0/) (PhysioNet)

### Pneumonia Detection:
- [Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) (Kaggle)

### COVID-19 Detection:
- [COVID-19 Image Repository](https://github.com/ml-workgroup/covid-19-image-repository) (GitHub)

## 4. Existing Project
- **Fastai.app**: [Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.fast&hl=en_US&pli=1), an app for detecting potential strokes.

## 5. Application
- **Primary Focus**: Detecting stroke.
- **Possible Extension**: Detection of other conditions like pneumonia, COVID-19, and common colds.

## 6. Target Audience
- **People**: The platform is designed to serve the general population by enabling early detection of strokes and other illnesses through the analysis of body movement images.
