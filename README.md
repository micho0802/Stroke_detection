# Multimodal for Stroke Detection



## 2. Dataset
- Facial dataset: The dataset comprises 5029 images across two classesâ€”acute stroke and non-stroke cases. Data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotation, and scaling, were applied to enhance model accuracy by diversifying and strengthening the dataset to more accurately reflect real-world scenarios.
