# Multimodal for Stroke Detection

This repository provides the code for our extension on applied machine learning in healthcare, particularly Multimodal for Stroke Detection. We provide an example of how our platform works with medical history and facial analysis.

## Dataset

The training dataset consists of 2 different source datasets. 

- Facial stroke data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danish003/face-images-of-acute-stroke-and-non-acute-stroke
- Medical history data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset


## Architecture
Like most capstone projects, the platform involves frontend, backend, and database architecture.

### Frontend:
- The frontend was built around the [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)


## Result

## Stroke prediction with face and medical history
