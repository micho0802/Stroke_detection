# UMKC_DS_Capstone

Capstone project for applying machine learning techniques.

## Ideas

### 1. Potential Stroke Detection:

1. Objective: Develop a platform that can detect strokes based on images of body movements, focusing primarily on facial expressions, heart rates, and fever patterns.
2. Extension: Maybe extension to detect other symptoms like pneumonia, COVID-19, etc
3. Data source: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danish003/face-images-of-acute-stroke-and-non-acute-stroke (stroke)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/afridirahman/brain-stroke-ct-image-dataset (stroke)
https://physionet.org/content/cves/1.0.0/ (stroke)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia (pneumonia chest x-ray)
https://github.com/ml-workgroup/covid-19-image-repository (covid-19)

4. Existence project: Fastai.app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.fast&hl=en_US&pli=1), an app to detect potential stroke
5. Application: detecting stroke and maybe an extension to common colds.
6. Target: people

### 3. Chat Bot about UMKC
Build a chatbot about UMKC and implement it into UMKC home mainpage. The idea is to assist student get to know more about the school (locations, hours, classes, scholarships, etc). The platform will utilize LLM to answer question from the student.
