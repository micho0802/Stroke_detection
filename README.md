Capstone project for applying machine learning techniques.

# Stroke Detection Platform

## Phase 1 (currently)

Objective: This step is to detect the potential stroke through camera fully 

- Train/test/validation on the acute stroke dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danish003/face-images-of-acute-stroke-and-non-acute-stroke):
  - Using ResNet50 and train on a GPU (GeForce GTX4770ti Super) -- Completed
  - Achieve an accuracy of 99.83%. -- Completed
- Create an LLM chatbot based on Reddit data (https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/):
  - Successfully retrieved Reddit API for the community. --Completed
  - Train a Transformer on Huggingface. -- In progress
  

## Phase 2 

Objective: Triangle model

- Connect frontend, backend and database
